         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119934:3"/>
that follow thereupon: all which I humbly conceive, may be very ſuitable for you, As well for the greatneſſe of your place and imployment, as it's neceſſary to be retained in your knowledge and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore in the firſt place, I preſent this to your <hi>Excellency,</hi> as unto a <hi>choiſe</hi> &amp; <hi>faithfull witneſs</hi> of the Lord; and after, to all thoſe that give forth their teſtimony for the truth and authority of Chriſt; againſt the falſhood and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's moſt certain, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth affirme, that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed by the <hi>brightneſſe of Chriſt's coming:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119934:3"/>
which is no other, then his coming forth in the bright beames, and glorious rayes of divine light, ſhining forth in his people. <hi>The Saints of the moſt High,</hi> by the teſtimony they give forth, are the <hi>rod of his mouth,</hi> and the <hi>breath of his lips;</hi> Whereby he will bruiſe his enemies, and breake them in pieces. Thus the true Spirit of Chriſt in the Saints, ſhall darken and dry up that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſeit and corrupt Spirit of Antichriſt, that is abroad in the world. But not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the power and authority of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhall be diſſipated and broken, (as it were) <hi>vi &amp; armis.</hi> And hence it is, that
<pb facs="tcp:119934:4"/>
in theſe times, the Lord hath appeared among us, <hi>as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man of warre,</hi> clothed with his zeale, as with a garment: and hath indued his people, with ſuch maſculine vertue &amp; ſtrength, that their <hi>hornes</hi> have been as <hi>iron,</hi> and their <hi>hoofs</hi> as <hi>braſſe,</hi> whereby they have <hi>threſhed the Mountaines, and the hills as Chaffe.</hi> And this they have not done by power or might, but by the Spirit of the Lord. It was the glorious appearance of GOD in the midſt of his people, that hath ſubdued theſe three Nations. Now though <hi>Dutch, Dane,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> ſhould combine againſt us, yet ſhall <hi>the arme
<pb facs="tcp:119934:4"/>
of the</hi> LORD awake for his people, and ſhall as in former dayes, cut <hi>Rachah,</hi> and wound the <hi>Dragon;</hi> he ſhall dry up the ſea, and the waters of the great deep. It's not an <hi>arme of fleſh</hi> can doe this, but a divine preſence with an Army, with whom are the hearts, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prayers, and ſpirits of the Saints, with a ſweet comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance gathered up into, and going along with them. This cauſes <hi>the ſhout of king</hi> to be in the midſt of us: though the king in his perſon be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet the everlaſting King <hi>lives,</hi> and ſhall take to himſelf his great power, and raigne.</p>
            <p>It's a moſt undeniable truth,
<pb facs="tcp:119934:5"/>
that the <hi>ſword</hi> hath been the originall of all kinds &amp; forms of government in the world: it's the <hi>mother</hi> of all power, protection, and preſervation. When any diſturbance doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in a kingdome or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, whither do they run? but unto a military pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ſuccour and defence, as not being able to ſubſiſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they do, as it were, reſolve into their firſt principles, And though the <hi>ſword</hi> in it's ſelfe be a dark and ſad diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eating fleſh, and drinking bloud, it's proper worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to waſt and deſtroy; yet when tis accompanied with wiſdom, righteouſneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb facs="tcp:119934:5"/>
and juſtice; it becom good and deſireable.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have but three words more to ſpeake. The firſt is <hi>of</hi> you. The ſecond <hi>to</hi> you. The third <hi>for</hi> you.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>you</hi> is, That the Lord hath ſo far honor'd you, as to make you an inſtrument of glorious atchievements: and hath made you head of your brethren, and hath given you a name with the great ones of the earth: but above all, he hath beſtowed on you the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Son, which makes you moſt acceptable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and precious in the eyes of his people.

               <bibl>REVELATIONS 11. 1.</bibl>
               <q>And there was given me a reed like unto a rod, and the Angel ſtood, ſaying, Riſe, and meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worſhip therein.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is much talke and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the two witneſſes, and great enquiry is made, to know, who they are, what is their teſtimony, whither they be ſlaine, when they ſhall riſe, &amp;c. All which I ſhall endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe, according to the meaſure of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119934:19"/>
light, that I have received, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and revelation of this myſtery.</p>
            <p>Before I make entrance upon this Chapter, give me leave, from the whole booke of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſix things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of the <hi>Author,</hi> who was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Chap. 1. 1. He is both the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and ſubject matter thereof, being the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> and all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beſides in this divine <hi>Revelation;</hi> in whom is the ſum and ſubſtance of all holy Writ, the whole myſtery of ſpirituall truth, all viſions of divine glory, lies wrapt up, doth meet and concenter in the perſon of the Lord Jeſus. Hence he is ſaid, to have the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſpirits of God,</hi> Chap. 1. 4. becauſe all perfection of knowledge was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in him, by which he is onely able to be the diſpenſer of ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly revelations and divine myſteries as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of the Meſſenger, that Chriſt doth here imploy, to convey this booke unto his Apoſtle, and that is an <hi>Angel:</hi> as is evident <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1. Now in that Chriſt doth ſignifie his meſſage unto <hi>John</hi> by an <hi>Angel;</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119934:19"/>
unto us, the great authority and power that Chriſt came forth in: He doth not appeare low and meanly, clothed in fleſh, or humane forme: but doth, as it were, ride upon the wings of an Angel; by the ſhining glory of an angelicall adminiſtration doth he declare this glorious myſtery.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, into whoſe hands theſe truths are committed, that is, into <hi>Johns,</hi> who was the beloved Diſciple of Chriſt, that leaned on his boſome, as having much neerneſſe and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with him. This <hi>John</hi> was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Divine;</hi> but not ſo much from dignity of office, as from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcellency of his graces and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointings. The Ancients did compare him to an <hi>Eagle,</hi> becauſe he ſoared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, in the knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſecrets of divine truth. This Apoſtle is honored above others, in writing this propheticall booke of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, take notice of the <hi>forme</hi> of this booke, it is caſt into the forme of an <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> containing things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, paſt, and to come, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 19. The things, that <hi>John had ſeen,</hi> were the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119934:20"/>
glorious appearance of Chriſt in the middeſt of the ſeven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 12, 13. The things that <hi>were</hi> in being, were thoſe ſeveral meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges both of praiſe and reprehenſion, that he was to give forth to the ſeven Churches, as appears in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and 3. The things <hi>to come,</hi> were the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that begin at <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4. and hold on to the end of the booke.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, we have preſented to us the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of this booke, and that's called a <hi>Revelation:</hi> and that becauſe it is not ſo much a doctrinall or hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call narration, as it is a ſymbolicall and propheticall prediction, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch glorious myſteries and divine <hi>Revelations,</hi> that did far ſurpaſſe the wiſdome, art, or reaſon of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creature: none but Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that by the mouth of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angel could bring to light or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſuch unutterable viſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, obſerve unto <hi>whom</hi> this booke was directed, and that was to the <hi>ſeven Churches in Aſia,</hi> Chapt. 1. 4. <hi>Seven</hi> is a perfect number, ſeven days containe mans labour and reſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119934:20"/>
ſeven times ſeven is the great Jubile of the Lord, and reſt of all things. So that theſe Churches being ſet forth by the number of <hi>ſeven,</hi> they are a compleat repreſentation of all Churches and all Saints. The perfect number of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and all beleevers are moſt lively deliniated and ſet forth by ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Therefore whatſoever is here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto, or ſpoken of the ſeven golden Candleſtickes; is both directed and ſpoken to all Churches and Saints in the world. Thus much to be noted of the booke in generall: Now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Chapter.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtand upon any curious, artificiall Analyſis of the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that which is principally contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, is the myſtery of the two Witneſſes; holding forth a deſcription of their perſons, and prophecie, their time and acts, their death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: in the opening whereof, we ſhall give much light to the whole booke, and much diſcover the ſecret myſtery wrapt up &amp; contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The two firſt verſes of the Chapter doe prepare us for what doth follow; and here I ſhall begin with the firſt.</p>
            <div n="1" type="verse">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119934:21"/>
               <head>And there was given me a reed like unto a rod, and the Angel ſtood, ſaying, Ariſe, and meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</head>
               <p>IN this verſe take notice of three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Johns</hi> call to meaſure the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>And the Angel ſtood, ſaying, ariſe, and meaſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His qualification for that worke; <hi>And there was given me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a reed like unto a rod.</hi> This was the inſtrument, that <hi>John</hi> was to meaſure by.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have the things, that were to be meaſured, they are name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, the <hi>Altar.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, the <hi>worſhippers</hi> therein.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall firſt open the words, and then give you ſome obſervations from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Angel ſtood, ſaying, ariſe.</hi> In <hi>Johns call,</hi> obſerve three things. Firſt, the Meſſenger, an <hi>Angel;</hi> this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119934:21"/>
denotes the eminent power and great authority, that this Meſſage was brought in unto <hi>John,</hi> as wee hinted before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the poſture of this <hi>Angel,</hi> he <hi>ſtood,</hi> which doth ſhew, his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and dexterity, his preparedneſſe and readineſſe to deliver his Meſſage, that is evidently implyed by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we have this Angels <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> ſaying, <hi>ariſe:</hi> thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>John</hi> to receive his meſſage. Now this command or direction of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, ſaying, <hi>ariſe,</hi> doth not imply that <hi>John</hi> was ſitting, and thereby to meane a change of his poſture, or mutation of his bodily ſtation; but rather, that he ſhould ſtir up his minde and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and raiſe up his thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; to attend unto that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious viſion or revelation, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was about to impart unto him. As if the Angel had ſaid, <hi>ariſe,</hi> lift up thy ſelfe far above thy carnall minde, and earthly affections: raiſe up thy thoughts and apprehenſion far higher then poore, low, earthly, and carnall things; to contemplate on things of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119934:22"/>
more ſpirituall and glorious, of a more divine and heavenly nature. So that tis not meant here a change of bodily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but a tranſlation of minde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider <hi>Johns qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the worke in hand; <hi>And there was given me a reed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like unto a red.</hi> It was the uſe of many Nations to meaſure things with <hi>reeds</hi> or <hi>canes,</hi> becauſe they were hollow and light, and ſo fit for that uſe. This <hi>reed</hi> was like unto a <hi>rod,</hi> which was alſo uſed in meaſuring: Hence it was, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were called the <hi>rod of Gods</hi> inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 2. So that by this <hi>reed</hi> like unto a rod, we have a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance unto the inſtruments, that the Nations did uſe, or of their manner of meaſuring: by which is ſignified the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord, the onely rule and ſtandard of divine things, that can give a true deſcription and dimention of the Temple of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have the things to be meaſured: and they are, firſt, The <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> ſecondly, the <hi>Altar,</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>worſhippers</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>Temple</hi> of God, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us the divine preſence of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119934:22"/>
the Lord with his people, which makes them his Temple and Tabernacle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. For yee are the Temple of the living God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walke in them,</hi> &amp;c. There is a cohabitation and a coambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between God and his people, they dwell together, they walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Lord by his divine preſence and in-dwelling of his ſpirit in their hearts, doth make them his glorious Temple. Suitable unto this, is that in <hi>Revel. 21. 3. Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,</hi> &amp;c. Which phraſe is an alluſion to the Tabernacle of old, mentioned in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 1. The Tabernacle was a ſolemne pledge &amp; ſigne of Gods preſence with his people; wherein was alſo the Arke of God kept; which doth intimate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, the Lords divine and ſpirituall preſence, by the coming downe of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of heaven, which is nothing elſe but the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the glory of God, the Spirit of Chriſt, ſhining forth, and dwelling in the hearts of Saints: making them his Temple and Tabernacle. Indeed Chriſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119934:23"/>
was the true Temple of God, who was prefigured by the former Temple, of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> but the Saints being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up into Chriſt, united to him in ſpirit, joyned to him as members, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the fulneſſe of his body; they alſo together with Chriſt become the Temple of the living God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Altar,</hi> doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us the true ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lord. The <hi>Altar</hi> was that whereon the Prieſt was to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in the Temple, or in the inner Court, that joyned to the Temple, which was the Prieſts Court, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted part of the Temple it ſelfe: both the Temple &amp; inner Court were holy, &amp; appropriated unto the Prieſts onely: but for the outward Court, it was common for all people to come into it. Now I ſay, the Altar that was in the Court of the Temple, doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the true and reall ſervice of the Lord: the worſhip that beleevers ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> all the prayers, thankeſgivings and praiſes they offer up, all their parts, gifts and graces that they imploy; all their pains, coſts, and endeavours; all theſe, I ſay, are the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119934:23"/>
ſacrifices that the Saints do continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offer up to God, by Jeſus Chriſt, the true Altar, upon which they offer. So that we have not onely Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his people, making of them his Temple; but here is alſo an Altar, or the divine and ſpirituall worſhip of all beleevers in the Temple, who are made an holy <hi>Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I Pet. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>They that worſhip therein.</hi> We are not onely to take notice of the <hi>worſhip,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>worſhippers,</hi> not onely of the Temple, but of thoſe that ſerve in the Temple; not onely of the Altar, but alſo of thoſe that offer thereon. The true <hi>worſhippers</hi> are thoſe that worſhip God in ſpirit, that draw nigh to him in faith and aſſurance, that know whom they worſhip, and worſhip him whom they know; theſe know him that is <hi>true;</hi> and they truly ſerve him. Here is a diſtinction made between the falſe worſhippers and the true; between thoſe that onely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the outward Court, mentioned in the next verſe, that onely worſhip in the externall forme, or ſuperficiall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119934:24"/>
part of things: and thoſe that are the true ſpirituall Prieſts of the Lord, who enter into the inner Court, and into the Temple of God, and worſhip there: Theſe are they, that the Lord doth take notice and accept of; that he will owne for his true worſhippers and ſervants; namely, thoſe that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his Temple, and offer upon his Altar.</p>
               <p>The words being thus opened, we come to take notice of ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that doe neceſſarily ariſe from them.</p>
               <p>The firſt obſervation is this: <hi>That</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I Obſerve:</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord doth ſuitably prepare his people to receive ſuch things, as himſelfe doth impart unto them.</hi> This is taken from <hi>Johns</hi> qualification, when the Angel bids him <hi>ariſe,</hi> to raiſe up his minde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from low, meane, and carnall apprehenſions and objects; and to fix them on thoſe things, that were divine and heavenly, even to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge of theſe heavenly myſteries, that the Lord revealed unto him, by the mouth of a mighty and ſtrong Angel. Suitable unto this is that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 1, 2. When the Angel
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119934:24"/>
ſounded his Trumpet, the voice ſayd; <hi>Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee things to come.</hi> Now what did this voyce ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, by ſaying; <hi>aſcend,</hi> or <hi>come up,</hi> &amp;c. it is not meant of his bodily motion, or change of his ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion; but a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or change of his minde: For ſaith <hi>John, Immediatly I was in the Spirit.</hi> That is, he was in a heavenly rapture or heavenly extaſie; he was ſpiritually carried up into heaven. The like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion we have in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. where the Apoſtle ſayth, he was <hi>caught up into the third heaven.</hi> Meaning thereby, that he was in an exceeding high and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rapture or ſpirituall tranſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of minde and ſpirit; that ſo he might heare thoſe unutterable revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine myſterie from the Lord. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> is taken up into the <hi>Mount</hi> with God, when he receives the Law at his mouth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 12. So were the Apoſtles taken up with Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Mount, to behold his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tranſfiguration, as the Apoſtle relateth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. Now by the Mount is reſembled, that high and heavenly pitch of a minde enlightned, of affections raiſed, of a heart ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allized,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119934:25"/>
whereby the Lord doth ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prepare his people to receive ſuch things, as hee doth diſcover unto them.</p>
               <p>Now as the Lord doth ſuitably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Saints to entertaine heavenly things, by enlarging their capacities, ſtrengthening their knowledge, and raiſing their affections; ſo he doth alſo make them to be of the ſame nature and quality as his diſcovery is, that he makes knowne unto them. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, whatſoever the voice of the creator is unto him. If the Lord ſpeak to any, onely by naturall things, as by corne, wine, and oyle, and the like: Such unto whom the Lord comes in theſe, and no more, they are meerly carnall and naturall, they heare God ſpeaking in theſe, and they cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend higher. And ſo if the Lord ſpeak in the heavenly viſions of divine glory through his Son unto any, then theſe unto whom he thus ſpeakes become gracious and heavenly, ſuitable unto the voice that ſpeakes unto them. It is ſaid, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. God hath ſpoken in theſe laſt dayes by his <hi>Son:</hi> and how is it then? the Apoſtle tells us in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119934:25"/>
6. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sonnes, God hath ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne into your hearts.</hi> So that when God ſpeaks to us by his Sonne, it makes us to be ſonnes alſo: and when we are ſonnes, then the Lord ſpeaks to us by the ſpirit of his Sonne. Whatſoever the voice of Chriſt is unto us, ſuch are our hearts; ſuch are our mindes and affections; the whole frame and nature of our ſpirits is ſuch as his diſcovery is unto us. Therefore it is moſt unpoſſible the Lord ſhould reveale heavenly myſteries, and ſhew forth his viſions of divine glory unto any; but he muſt alſo raiſe up the minds &amp; affections of ſuch unto ſome proportionable and ſuitableneſſe of ſpirit, to receive ſuch revelations from his mouth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve; <hi>That the ſpirit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of the Lord is the onely rule and ſtandard of divine and heavenly things.</hi> This is taken from <hi>Johns</hi> qualification, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him to meaſure the Temple. <hi>And there was given me a reed like unto a rod:</hi> Which <hi>reed</hi> or <hi>rod</hi> doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us the Spirit of the Lord, the true rule and meaſure of divine truth. The word and ſpirit are all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119934:26"/>
one: for ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Joh. 6. 63. My words are ſpirit and life.</hi> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward word is but the clothing of the ſpirit, neither hath it life and power, but as the ſpirit doth goe forth in it. Then the ſpirit is the true meaſure whereby we may take an equall ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or true dimention of heavenly things. This is that the Apoſtle doth plainly tell us in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. That the Spirit doth reveale the deep things of God. So that the deep and hidden things, the moſt ſecret myſteries of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-truth are revealed unto us by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now what man is it that doth not imagine he hath the true meaſure and rule of the things of God? Every man pretends it, and lays claime unto it. Therefore before I paſſe this poynt, I ſhall ſhew upon what grounds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are miſtaken; and alſo make knowne what are the true foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and principles of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſcernnance of the things of God. Concerning the falſe rules, whereby men miſtake, take notice of theſe which follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Fleſhly wiſdome and carnall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119934:26"/>
reaſon are the principles that many men thinke to finde out truth by; and by theſe principles of nature they would profeſſe to attaine unto the knowledge of divine things: but there is an utter inability in man, by all his corrupted principles of nature, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judge or diſcerne of ſpirituall things. Chriſt tells <hi>Nicodemus, That which is borne of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>ſpirituall man;</hi> or one enlightned by the ſpirit of God. Now the <hi>naturall</hi> man is not able to judge of things above the principles of nature; for every truth is diſcerned by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of light, ſuitable to it ſelfe. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. No man knoweth the things of man, but the ſpirit of man that is in him.</hi> Now what are the things of man? but all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119934:27"/>
created things, of whom man is the epitome or compendium of them all, they being all comprehended within him, as in a Mapp or ſhort abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo as for the ſecret and hidden things of nature, or of the creature, there is none can fadome or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, but the ſpirit of man, or the reaſon, wiſdome, or underſtanding of man. So it falls out in the things of God; for ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God.</hi> Heavenly things are onely judged and diſcerned by him that is ſpirituall, who judgeth all things by a true light. Then it is in vaine for man to grope in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his own wiſdome and reaſon after the knowledge of heavenly truth. Mans knowledge is a weak and dimme light, as the light of a Candle, to the light of the day, or like the ſhine of the Moon unto the glory of the Sun: it is a low, fleſhly, and moſt unperfect light, and altogether inſufficient to meaſure divine things by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Many there be, that ground their knowledge of divine things upon ſome barren <hi>notion,</hi> or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119934:27"/>
fruitleſſe <hi>opinion,</hi> or meer <hi>ſpeculation;</hi> and when they have got ſome jejune and dry Maximes of Divinity, or ſome poor, lean, and ſapleſſe ſyllogiſticall reaſonings, that then thinke they have attained to a moſt compleat know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things of God, and that they are well ſeen in the myſtery of truth: when alas, all theſe things are not ſufficient to preſent unto the ſoul the leaſt glimpſe of true and ſaving light.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Others thinke that the whole myſtery of truth is bound up, or comprehened within ſome circle or forme of Religion. Such as theſe are apt to ſay, <hi>Lo here, and lo there,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks in <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 21. that is, Lo here is Chriſt in this way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in this form of Religion, in this opinion and doctrine: but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The kingdome of God is within you;</hi> That is, The kingdome of God is not ſo much of forme, but of power: of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and peace, of light and joy, of love and life; and all theſe are beſt manifeſted within us; for Chriſt is beſt knowne where he lives. It hath been the practice of Antichriſt, to cry up
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119934:28"/>
the Temple of the Lord; while they cry downe the Lord of the Temple: and to take up the forme of Religion, as a meanes to perſecute the power thereof. Then tis not an empty and barren forme of Religion that can furniſh us with the true light of the kingdome of Chriſt, or the knowledge of his will.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the moſt of men thinke, that if they have ſome hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call knowledge of Chriſt, and ſome literall knowledge of the Scriptures, and are trained up as Parrets to ſpeake over ſuch things as they read in books and Treatiſes; and are well verſed in the Syſtems and body of Divinity; that then they are ſufficiently inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the myſteries of the Goſpel; when alas the truths of God are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from their eyes; and every word and letter they read are written with an unknowne character, which cannot be deciphered without the Spirit of God. The moſt learned Scribe, the greateſt Rabbie, that ſhall underſtand the Originall language, in which the Text of Scripture was firſt written, as the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the <hi>Greeke;</hi> but yet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119934:28"/>
ſhall want the language of the Spirit, cannot give a true interpretation of the hidden and ſecret truths contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture. There is not onely a hiſtory, but alſo a myſtery of Chriſt: there is not onely letter, but alſo Spirit in the Scriptures, which the moſt learned in the world cannot finde out, without the Spirit of Chriſt. The Apoſtle gives in a full teſtimony unto this in citing of that place, which ſaith; <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdome of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the prudent: where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this world? hath not God made fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the wiſdome of this world?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 19, 20. Then tis not carnall reaſon or fleſhly wiſdome: tis not a barren notion, or meer ſpeculation: tis not a round circle or empty forme: tis not a literall knowledge or hiſtoricall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſt and the Scriptures, that are ſound principles of ſaving light, or the true meaſures or rules, by which we may diſcerne ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewen rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whereby men are miſtaken in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119934:29"/>
their judgement of divine things. Now it followeth in the ſecond place, that wee make a diſcovery of thoſe principles of light and truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may come to a true ſight and knowledge of the things of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Divine truths are knowne by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us in 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 6. The ſpirit is truth.</hi> The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the fulleſt, the higheſt, the moſt abſolute, and the moſt comprehenſive truth: it's the originall and ground; it's perfection and end; it's the judge and ſtandard of all truth. It is moſt true, that God hath made <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> the judge and ſtandard of ſuch truths, that are within their owne compaſſe and circuit; and are able to perceive and diſcerne ſuch objects, that are ſuitable to themſelves; but they can aſcend no higher. Now for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, ſaith, the Apoſtle, they are <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. They cannot be judged or rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without a ſpirituall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and enlightned judgement: therefore he ſaith in verſe 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, eare hath not heard,</hi> &amp;c. That is, both the ſenſe of ſeeing and hearing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119934:29"/>
and alſo the reaſon and underſtanding of the heart, are poore, low, and darke principles, too ſuperficiall, too ſcant and narrow to judge divine things by. Therefore the Apoſtle concludes in verſ. 11. That none <hi>knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God:</hi> which <hi>ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the deep things of God;</hi> it is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone openeth the deep and hidden my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of truth. And hence the Apoſtle affirmes in verſe 15. <hi>The ſpirituall man judgeth, or diſcerneth all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Heavenly things are beſt diſcovered by a divine impreſſion of them on the heart. This is that the Apoſtle teſtifies of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Yee are our Epistle, written in our hearts, knowne and read of all men: for as much as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, not in Tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly Tables of the heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 2, 3. As if the Apoſtle had ſaid; yee are the ſeal of our Apoſtleſhip, ye are our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory letters; the truth is moſt of all manifeſted by that divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it hath upon your hearts, it's written there with a more lively cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119934:30"/>
and more eaſie to be deciphered, then if it were written with inke and paper, or on. Tables of ſtone. The truths of God are not ſo well diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the word and letter without us, as by the word and ſpirit within us. The myſtery of the Goſpel is moſt of all ſeen, when it is engraven upon our hearts, by the indeleble characters of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To know the truth aright, is to know it in <hi>Jeſus;</hi> according to that expreſſion of the Apoſtle in <hi>Epheſ. 4. 21, 22. If ſo be, that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus: that ye put off concerning the former converſation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitfull luſts: and be renewed in the ſpirit of your minde: and that ye put on the new man, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle ſhews plainly, that to know the truth in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is by the putting off the old man, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: and by putting on the new man, &amp;c. wherein he doth compare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and corrupt eſtate of man, to an old worn-out garment, which is fit for nothing but to be caſt off &amp; layd aſide:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119934:30"/>
and the new man (which is the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the image of Gods righteouſnes and holines on the ſoul) he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to a new garment, fit to put on, &amp; be adorned withall: and hereby our mindes ſhall be renewed, changed and regenerated from the naturall depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the underſtanding, will and affections; and wholly be filled and acted with ſpirit, light, &amp; life of Chriſt. And hereby are we able to diſcerne the truths of Jeſus, as they are manifeſted to our new man; or as they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our mindes, as being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the image and glory of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, we come to know the truth, by our conformity unto it. When there is a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance of our ſpirits with the will of God, then we come to know moſt of the myſtery of his will. And this Chriſt himſelfe doth beare witneſſe of, when he ſaith; <hi>If any man will doe his will, he ſhall know of my doctrine,</hi> Joh. 7. 17. Now what is it to do the will of God? but to have an harmonious conſent, and ſweet complyance of our wills, with the divine will of God: whereby
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119934:31"/>
our wills are more enlarged in the knowledge and extent of his will; our wills and his will, as it were meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and concentring in one. Thus the ſoule becomes beſt acquainted with the knowledge of the truth, and is enabled to underſtand the unknowne and hidden myſteries of heavenly things, whereby it is able to judge aright, and give a true dimention or meaſure of them. And thus much for the rules or principles by which we are to judge and meaſure divine things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, from the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> being meaſured; <hi>That the Lord hath alwayes afforded his divine preſence with his people; even in the darkeſt and ſaddeſt time of Antichriſts raigne.</hi> The meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Temple here, hath an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. where the Temple was meaſured, that it might appeare the whole frame and order thereof was from the Lord. So here, the Lord doth preſerve a holy people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and by his divine preſence with them, doth meaſure them out for his Temple. So that he doth preſerve a ſpirituall forme of a Temple, by his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119934:31"/>
divine preſence with his people, even all the times of the generall Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Apoſtacie and defection, when there was no outward forme of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when Antichriſt ſat in the viſible Temple, and exalted himſelfe above all, graſping all power and authority, all rule and dominion; then I ſay, at the very time of the powerfull raigne of the Man of ſin; God would have us take notice, that he did preſerve a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelfe, and by his divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, love, and protection did make them his Temple.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring<note place="margin">4 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> of the <hi>Altar; That the Lord had alwayes a people, that did truly worſhip him.</hi> Chriſt is the true Altar of God, and all the Saints are made ſpirituall Prieſts, to offer up their ſacrifices and ſervices on him. The Saints draw nigh to God in ſincerity, they ſerve the Lord in ſpirit, they worſhip him in ſpirit. They did alway offer up upon the true Altar; ſacrificing all that was deare unto them, their friends, their goods, their preferments, their parts, their lives, and all that was deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Such hath been the love of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119934:32"/>
the faithfull unto the ſervice of Chriſt, that not withſtanding all the rage and ſury of Antichriſt, vexing and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, by impriſoument and death, and whatſoever could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them, yet they could never be made weary of the profeſſion of Chriſt; but their faith and graces have alwayes been ſo impregnable and indefatigable, that they could never be worne out, or made to give over the ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, in that the true<note place="margin">5 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> worſhippers muſt be meaſured; <hi>That the Lord doth accept of none but his true worſhippers; ſuch as worſhip in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and offer upon his Altar.</hi> Chriſt is the true Temple in which we muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the holy Altar, upon which we muſt offer: and they onely are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accepted that make uſe of him; they are onely to be meaſured and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. Now for all others, of what profeſſion or quality ſoever; be their externall formes of worſhip and ſervice never ſo glorious or amiable in the ſight of men; yet it is rejected, caſt forth and diſowned; if they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not in the true Temple, if they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119934:32"/>
offer not upon the everlaſting Altar, that God hath appointed for all his. Hence it is, the Lord ſaith, take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe that worſhip in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, theſe are they that I owne; I take notice of none but theſe; I will accept of no more: Theſe are they that ſerve me in truth, and worſhip me in ſpirit; and I will owne them and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them for my owne.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, for as much as<note place="margin">6 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Temple, Altar,</hi> and <hi>worſhippers</hi> muſt be meaſured. Obſerve, <hi>That the Lord hath alwayes had a people, that have been mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of divine things. John</hi> here did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate all Saints, who in all ages and periods of time, under the ſury and rage of Antichriſt, have been ready to give in a teſtimony for Chriſt and his truth: and have alwayes born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt the man of ſin, the Son of perdition; and againſt all his ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious formes of worſhip; alwayes caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and rejecting his ſervice and inventions. Every one according to his meaſure, hath been ready to ſtand up, and give in their Teſtimonies for the truth of Chriſt, againſt the falſhood of AntiChriſt. So much for the firſt verſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the prohibition it ſelfe: <hi>Leave it out, meaſure it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The reaſon of this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; <hi>for it is given to the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The uſe that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles make of the outward Court, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119934:33"/>
the holy City; <hi>They tread them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, How long? <hi>Fortie and two moneths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That which muſt not be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, is the <hi>outward Court:</hi> ſo called, as being diſtinct from the <hi>inward Court,</hi> which was appropriate to the Prieſts, in which was the <hi>Altar,</hi> where they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſacrifice, which was alſo adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temple. This <hi>outward Court</hi> is here ſpoken by an alluſion to that mentioned in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 17. which was far larger and bigger then the inner Court. Therefore called, The <hi>great Court,</hi> 2 Chron. 4. 9. being wide and large enough to containe multitudes of people. This was not hallowed as the inner Court, and Temple was; but was common for all people.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>outward Court</hi> is meant all Antichriſts worſhips and worſhippers, even the whole ſurface or ſuperficiall part of things, as all outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, all externall formes of worſhip, power, order, government, wiſdome, art, or whatſoever is without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; all that the Gentiles or carnall profeſſors may take up and be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119934:34"/>
exerciſed in, theſe be all the outward Court. The outward face of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church was given to Antichriſt, to Gentiles, to worldly Chriſtians to uſe and enjoy: while the true ſervants of the Lord are ſerving him in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, as in the inner Court of the Temple: They were that inward and ſecret Temple, with whom the Lord was preſent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The prohibition it ſelfe; <hi>Leave it out, meaſure it not.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to <hi>caſt forth,</hi> as we uſe to caſt things of no value out of doors. As if he had ſaid, caſt it forth as common and of no uſe, account it not of the Temple, nor of any part thereof; but rather eſteeme it as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Gentiles, which they may enjoy, and be exerciſed in, therefore meaſure it not. Now by <hi>meaſuring</hi> of the <hi>Temple, Altar,</hi> and <hi>worſhippers,</hi> he was to take a true dimention of the ſervants of God, who worſhipped him in Chriſt, and ſerved him in ſpirit: who were the true, inviſible, and ſecret Temple of God; ſerving the Lord in the wilderneſſe. Then by not <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the outward Court</hi> is meant thus
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119934:34"/>
much; That he ſhould not meaſure or judge the true ſervants of the Lord by externall things; for the outward face of the viſible Church was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Gentiles; and that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was to ſit in the Temple of God: and ſhould exerciſe in all externall formes of worſhip, order, government, he ſhould exerciſe in all outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in the higheſt acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as prayer, preaching, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the Scriptures, and the like: and therefore though theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles or Antichriſtian profeſſors ſhould thus exerciſe themſelves in formes of worſhip: in Church-government, in higheſt externall acts of Religion: were called Chriſtians; poſſeſſing and injoying the outward face of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; yet they were not to be accounted as the Temple of God; to be of his ſtructure or building, as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the true reed, or weighed by the ballance of the Sanctuary; they were not to be accounted as Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Church, or to be the true Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The reaſon of this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; <hi>For it is given unto the Gentiles.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:119934:35"/>
All worldly Chriſtians and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſors are here called <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by an alluſion to thoſe, that were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto the Jewes; they were called <hi>Heathens and Gentiles,</hi> as appeares in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1. And the Pſalmiſt complaines in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 1. ſaying; <hi>O God, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> (or the Gentiles) <hi>are come into thine inheritance, thy holy Temple have they defiled, they have layd Jeruſalem on heaps,</hi> &amp;c. This was the complaint of the Church of the Jewes unto the Lord, againſt the moſt barbarous tyranny of the Babylonians, when they raz'd Jeruſalem, polluted the Temple, and murdered the people. So here the ſons of ſpirituall Babylon, who moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly and cruelly torment the Saints, and tread the holy City under foot; theſe alſo are called <hi>Gentiles and heathen.</hi> Now ſaith he, the outward Court is not to be <hi>meaſured;</hi> becauſe it is given to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> it is a Gentiles portion: a worldly Chriſtian, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall profeſſor may take up, uſe, and be exerciſed in any of theſe externall things: he may take up the higheſt forme of worſhip, he may make the greateſt profeſſion of Godlineſſe: he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119934:35"/>
may be exerciſed in the moſt eminent acts of Religion; therefore meaſure not my true ſervants and Temple by theſe, they are but the outward Court, and the portion of Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What uſe doth the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles make of theſe things? They <hi>tread them under foot. And the holy City ſhall they tread,</hi> &amp;c. By an alluſion to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the Saints are called the <hi>holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> which was a figure of the ſpirituall Church and Temple of God: in which reſpect they are called <hi>Jeruſalem from above,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. The <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> the holy City, <hi>Revel. 3. 12. Mount Sion, Heb.</hi> 12. 22. So that by the <hi>holy Citie</hi> is meant the Saints, called the <hi>holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Dan. 8. 24. and 12. 7. Now the beſt uſe that theſe Gentiles make, both of the outward Court, and of the holy Citie is but to prophane and trample upon them. As for all the externall formes of ſervice, government, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and all acts of Religion, the beſt uſe they make of them, is like beaſts and ſwine to tread them under feet; not knowing how to make a better uſe of them. And for the Saints, the holy City, theſe they abuſe and perſecute,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119934:36"/>
they know not how to make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of theſe, then ſwine doe of pearles.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, How long? <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and two moneths.</hi> The <hi>terme</hi> of forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two moneths, allowing thirty dayes to every moneth, allowing thirty dayes to every moneth, make the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 1260 dayes, mentioned in the next verſe. In the next Chapter and ſixth verſe, <hi>The woman flies into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, there to be nouriſhed a thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes:</hi> and in verſe 14. it's expreſſed by a <hi>Time, times, and halfe a time:</hi> by a <hi>time</hi> is meant a <hi>year,</hi> by <hi>times two yeares,</hi> by <hi>halfe a time, halfe a yeare,</hi> which is <hi>three yeares,</hi> and a <hi>halfe,</hi> being reſolved into <hi>dayes,</hi> make 1260 dayes: if into moneths, they make forty two moneths. To which agrees the terme of <hi>three dayes and a halfe,</hi> in verſ. 9. of this Chapter. Theſe dayes being put for yeares, they make juſt three yeares and a halfe. So that the Gentiles treading downe the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>forty two moneths:</hi> and the beaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing <hi>forty two moneths,</hi> Chapt. 13. 5. And the ſpace of 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> that the Witneſſes ſhall propheſie; as alſo the woman being nouriſhed in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119934:36"/>
and the time, times, and halfe a time; with the three dayes and a halfe, that the Witneſſes ſhall lie dead: I ſay, all theſe various expreſſions of time, appeare to be all one and the ſame ſpace. And ſo it appeares, that the time of the propheſie of the Witneſſes, and the continuance of the raigne of the beaſt to be one and the ſame. Some would have this number 1260 dayes, turned into yeares, and ſo would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the whole terme of the raigne of the beaſt, and the propheſie of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to continue 1260 yeares. I ſhall not contradict this opinion; but ſhall thus far cloſe with it, as to conclude, that the terme of time ſignified by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two moneths, and 1260 dayes, is the whole time of Antichriſts raigne, and of the Witneſſes prophecying in ſackcloth. But I intend not to make it my buſineſſe to calculate the years of Antichriſts powerfull raigne, or the time of the Witneſſes propheſie; but rather to ſearch out ſomething from the myſtery of truth, that is contained therein.</p>
               <p>This <hi>terme</hi> of <hi>forty two moneths,</hi> doth not onely h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and age of Antichriſt, in which he ſhall tread under the holy City, and ſcatter the power of the holy people; but doth alſo import the different and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearances and workings of his: ſo that various ſhapes and formes, the ſeverall diſguiſes and habits that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt doth cloath himſelfe withall, and come forth in, to act his part, and deceive the Nations: are held forth unto us under the <hi>Terme</hi> of <hi>forty two moneths.</hi> Therefore here we are to note, that the <hi>time</hi> of the Witneſſes propheſie is ſaid to be 1260 <hi>dayes.</hi> Now a <hi>day</hi> is meaſured out by the Sun, as a moneth is by the Moon: the courſe of the <hi>Sun</hi> is by <hi>dayes,</hi> which is a time more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and of more light then the night. But now the time of the raigne of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is expreſſed by <hi>forty</hi> and <hi>two moneths:</hi> now a moneth is a ſeaſon meaſured out by the Moon; and ſhews that in all things there is but a Moon light, a weak and dim light, a light borrowed from the Sun.

Every one of theſe have their moneths and ſeaſons meaſured out unto them, in which they variouſly appeare, and act their parts. But more of this hereafter: having explained the words, let us proceed to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations they offer unto us.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119934:38"/>
ſpirit: It was the Prieſt onely, that might enter into the inner Court, or into the Temple and holy place. So the Saints alone are <hi>made Prieſts to God,</hi> Revel. 1. 6. <hi>And have acceſſe</hi> (or liberty of ſpeech, as the phraſe is) <hi>to enter into the holy place, by a new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 20.

But now for all Gentiles, Chriſtians, and worldly profeſſors, they dwell upon and live in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part of things, in the forme and ſhaddow of heavenly things: they never goe farther then the outward Court or circle of the things of God. Thus it was with the carnall Jewes, as plainly appeares in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. from verſ. 1. to verſe 7. <hi>Moreover brethren, I would not that ye ſhould be ignorant,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all paſſed thorow the Sea: and were all Baptized unto Moſes, in the Cloud, and in the Sea: and did all eat the ſame ſpirituall meat: and did all drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke (for they dranke of that ſpirituall Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Chriſt) but with many of them God was not well pleaſed, for they

For what uſe did theſe carnall Jewes make of their <hi>ſpirituall meat and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drinke?</hi> The Apoſtle tels us in verſe 7. They were <hi>Idolaters: for they eat and dranke, and roſe up to play.</hi> They did but Idolize thoſe heavenly things, by ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and playing with them; for it is the nature of carnall profeſſors either to abuſe their forme of worſhip, or elſe to make their ſervice their God, by idolizing of it. It was the cuſtome of the Gentiles to worſhip ſuch things, as beaſts and birds <hi>for</hi> their God, as the Jewes were to offer in ſacrifice <hi>unto</hi> God. Thus doe all heatheniſh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they ſacrifice to their externall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119934:39"/>
formes of worſhip and ſervice: they never aſcend higher then the outward part, they never paſſe the outward Court; They know not what it is to worſhip God in his ſecret Temple, nor to offer upon his holy Altar.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve, from the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition<note place="margin">2 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> it ſelfe; <hi>Meaſure it not. That the Temple, worſhip, and ſervants of God are not to be meaſured by outward things.</hi> We may not take a ſurvey, or make a dimention either of the ſervice or Saints of God, by the outward and externall part of things; for there is no outward forme of worſhip, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act of Religion, but Antichriſt doth take up and make uſe of. For mark it, <hi>John</hi> was called to take a true ſcantlet of the true Temple, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worſhippers of God: now he was not to meaſure them by the externall or ſuperficiall worſhip and profeſſion; for ſo he might be miſtaken; for the Gentiles, and Antichriſtian profeſſors might and ſhould poſſeſſe the outward face of worſhip, and performe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall acts of Religion. Then if we judge of the true Temple and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God by this or that forme, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119934:39"/>
government, or opinion; inſtead of meaſuring the Temple and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God, we meaſure but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court: we conteſt, wrangle and diſpute about thoſe things that wax old and will periſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>That the outward</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>forme of divine things is given for a time into the hands of Antichriſt.</hi> This is given as a reaſon why the outward Court was not to be meaſured; becauſe it was <hi>given to the Gentiles.</hi> The externall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and formes of worſhip were to be for a time, the portion of worldly Chriſtians, they might take them, they might enjoy them. Antichriſt ſits in the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 4. There he raigneth and domineereth, exalting himſelfe as God in all ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and prerogative. So that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and carnall profeſſors, may take upon them all rule, power, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: outward profeſſion, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worſhip: theſe they may enjoy, for it is their portion for a time, and they may poſſeſſe them; but more then theſe they meddle not withall: they have the outward Court, and they poſſeſſe no more. Theſe have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119934:40"/>
Court, or externall things of God given into their hand for a time, no otherwiſe then the carnall Jewes were made partakers of outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, being the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> as we may take notice from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The Apoſtle lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his kinſmen in the fleſh, ſaith; <hi>Who were Iſraelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes: whoſe are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came,</hi> &amp;c. Here take notice of the greatneſſe of the Jewes privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Firſt, they are <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of the <hi>adoption,</hi> accounted his <hi>Sons</hi> and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, above all Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. Secondly, there appertained to them the <hi>glory,</hi> the <hi>Arke</hi> of the Covenant, apledge of Gods preſence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 21. Thirdly, And the <hi>Covenants,</hi> temporall and ſpirituall. Fourthly, And the <hi>Law,</hi> Judiciall and morall. Fifthly, The <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God,</hi> the whole forme and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of divine worſhip. Sixtly, The <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed. But notwithſtanding they were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of all theſe externall priviledges,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119934:40"/>
they enjoyed but as it were the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of them: for take notice what he ſaith in verſe 6, 7, 8. <hi>For they are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael: neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all Children: but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Hence it is evident, that they that were born of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after the courſe of nature: ſuch were not accounted as the children of God; for ſaith he, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called:</hi> now <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a childe of <hi>promiſe:</hi> ſo onely the children of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> the ſpirituall ſeed, they were accounted for children. So that the carnall Jew enjoyed no more then outward priviledge, then an externall forme of the things of God: and all ſuch they might enjoy as they were the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a Gentile Chriſtian, a carnall profeſſor may enjoy the outward Court, the externall part of worſhip, the empty forme of Religion: theſe things are given into the hands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt for a time; theſe are their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they may poſſeſſe them. But the externall part is all they have, or can enjoy, that they take up, they own,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119934:41"/>
they are exerciſed in; not knowing the true, inward Temple of the Lord, his Altar, or thoſe that worſhip him in ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, <hi>That the beſt uſe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that Antichriſt and the world doe make of the outward Court and the holy Citie, it is but to prophane, abuſe, and trample upon them.</hi> As for the <hi>holy Citie,</hi> they ſhall trample upon it; and as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks, they ſhall ſcatter the power of the <hi>holy people:</hi> they ſhall perſecute them by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, baniſhment, death; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting all manner of evill they can deviſe againſt them. And as for all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall formes of worſhip, order, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Churches, Scriptures, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, &amp;c. All theſe they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and abuſe; they know not how to make a better uſe of theſe, then to pollute and trample upon them. Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto this was the practice of the Scribes and Phariſees, the leaders of the people of the Jewes, of whom the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> complaines; ſaying; <hi>They have eaten up the good paſture, but the reſidue they tread downe with their feete; and they drinke of the deep waters; but foule the reſidue with their feet: and as for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119934:41"/>
my flock, they eat that which ye have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with your feet, and drinke that which ye have fouled with your feet,</hi> Ezek. 34. 18, 19. By the good paſture and deep water is meant the pure word; or a compleat nouriſhment by theſe is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the flock: but the Scribes and Phariſees would eat of theſe good paſtures, and drinke of theſe ſweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, what of them they liked, they would feed on that, which ſhould up hold their dignity and greatneſſe, and ſerve their purpoſes and ends, and ſuit with their gaine and advantages: but for the other part or reſidue, or that which ſhould feed my people with knowledge and underſtanding (ſaith the Lord) that you will tread downe with your feet, abuſe and trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that is, they would corrupt the word of God and his truth, by their falſe gloſſes and interpretations, by forcing their own expoſitions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which they make or draw from the Scriptures: that ſo the people might feed on that, which they had trampled on with their feet, that they had mixed, corrupted, and abuſed, as themſelves pleaſed. The ſame hath
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119934:42"/>
been the conſtant practice of Antichriſt, who by his forced tranſlations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scripture, by his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall government, and invented ordinances, hath ſubjected all people under him, into Aegyptian darkneſſe, and Babyloniſh captivity. Thus hath he corrupted the externall part of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and abuſed, ſuppreſſed, and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot the holy City. But how long ſhall this be? <hi>Fortie two moneths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, <hi>That Antichriſt hath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>his prefixed and limitted time to raigne and domineer in.</hi> It is moſt true that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſpirit of Antichriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes acted its part: it is that very ſeed of the Serpent, that hath oppoſed the very image of God from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that hath ſhewed it ſelfe in all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> beginning in <hi>Caine,</hi> and paſſing to all the ſeed in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: but we muſt note, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in his power and forme, hath but a ſeaſon and an appointed time: for this doth not note the time, in which the ſeed of the Serpent ſhould make warre againſt the ſeed of the woman; but rather the time, when the ſubtilty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119934:42"/>
and envy of the Serpent was put forth and exerciſed in the cruelty of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and raigne and power of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> So that the evill ſpirit that Chriſt oppoſed in the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, was no other, then the ſpirit of Antichriſt now: but ſince the generall defection, and falling away, this evill ſpirit hath put on the forms of diverſe beaſts, moſt fierce and cruell: ſo that this <hi>forty two moneths</hi> is the time of the powerfull raigne of the man of ſinne. Now for the time of the powerfull raigne of Antichriſt, he hath but his moneths, and his ſeaſons; and it will be, that time ſhall be no more: when the Lord ſhall come in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ames and brightneſſe of his glory, ſhining from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, and making a full diſcovery of the nakedneſſe of the whore, ſhe ſhall utterly be deſtroyed, and ſhall raigne no more.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Obſerve; <hi>That the ſhapes and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6 <hi>Obſerve</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>formes in which Antichriſt comes forth in to act his part, are various and changeable.</hi> Therefore it is, that his time is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by moneths, and not by dayes: his time is not meaſured by the Sun, which is light and conſtant;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119934:43"/>
but by the Moone, which is dim in light, and moſt variable and unconſtant in appearance. So that the appearances of Antichriſt are variable, unconſtant, and changeable as the <hi>Moon:</hi> now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in this ſhape: by and by in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Sometimes in this forme, another time wholly diſguiſed into ſomething elſe, and ſo never long at one ſtay. Thus the ſubtilty of Antichriſt is to fly out of one forme into another, and when he is detected and diſcovered in one guiſe, he will put on ſome habit of reformation and piety; but it ſhall be but the deceivableneſſe of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in which he ſhall appeare, to miſlead people by: therefore know, as his laſt time or moneth ſhall be his ſhorteſt, ſo his laſt habit and dreſſe, that he ſhall come forth in ſhall be the fineſt, and moſt apt to deceive.</p>
               <p>Therefore let all Saints <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>keep their garments, leaſt they be made walke naked, and their ſhame appeare, Revel.</hi> 16. 15. Let every one arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the wiles and methods of Antichriſt, that ſo we may be able to trace him in all his wayes, and finde him out under all his diſguiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:119934:43"/>Now before I paſſe the thing in hand, it will be neceſſary that I make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Antichriſt: as to enquire what he is.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>myſtery.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, in <hi>forme,</hi> and <hi>appearance.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Concerning Antichriſt in ſpirit, take a deſcription by theſe four heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpirit of Antichriſt is that evill and corrupt ſpirit in man, that oppoſeth Jeſus Chriſt, his image and glory, his truth and appearance. This is that the Apoſtle calls, the <hi>carnall minde</hi> or ſpirit of enmity, that dwells in the heart of man; which is the wiſdome of the fleſh, oppoſing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. This ſpirit hath had it's rule and raigne in man ever ſince mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and fall from God. This is the <hi>old man,</hi> or <hi>man of ſin,</hi> the <hi>ſon of perdition,</hi> that doth alwayes endeavour to betray and crucifie the very life, light, image, and glory of Chriſt in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The originall and life of this evill ſpirit, is the cloſe of the heart of man with Satan, the Prince &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſſe; who doth tranſforme himſelfe into an Angel of light, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the reaſon, wiſdome, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119934:44"/>
of man, above the ſpirit or pure anointing of God. And ſo while he draws man to worſhip God, in the wiſdome, power, and parts of the creature; it proves but the <hi>deceivable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of unrighteouſneſſe, or acting in the power of Satan, and of the fleſh, and doth containe no more then the <hi>ſignes</hi> and <hi>ſhadowes</hi> of heavenly things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſpirit <hi>ſits in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, as God;</hi> That is, it doth put forth it ſelfe, and act its part; in every act and performance, in every duty and ordinance, that man doth performe, or exerciſe himſelfe in. So that as Chriſt doth enable the ſoule to performe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine actions, by his wiſdome, power, and ſpirit; ſo doth Antichriſt, carry forth the ſoule to act by humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, fleſhly power, carnall parts and gifts; and ſo deceives the ſoule by this falſe ſpirit, or falſe anointing, inſtead of the true anointing or pure ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, This ſpirit of wickedneſſe alwayes acts in a <hi>myſtery</hi> of iniquity. Now it's called a <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>iniquity,</hi> becauſe it is not in it's proper place, where it may be better knowne
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119934:44"/>
or diſcerned: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The workes of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are adultery, fornication, uncleanneſſe, laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal. 5. 19.</hi> Theſe fleſhly actings, being in their proper place, are ſo evident, that they are eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, there is no man but knows theſe, and will ſay they are evill; but as for the workes of Antichriſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the ſtrength of carnall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, fleſhly power, humane parts, and the like: theſe actings are cryed up to be holy and righteous, when they are but the more refined part of man, the righteouſneſſe of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or old man, and containe the very myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity. To this purpoſe will ſerve that place in <hi>Matth. 12. 44, 45. When the uncleane ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, ſeeking reſt, and finding none: then he ſaith, I will returne into my houſe from whence I came out: and when he is come, he findeth it emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſwept, and garniſhed: Then goeth he, and taketh with himſelfe, ſeven other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more wicked then himſelfe, and they enter in, and dwell there,</hi> &amp;c. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the workings of iniquity, doth appeare from this Text. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119934:45"/>
ſpirit caſt forth of man, is the ſpirit of open and groſs prophanneſſe, the naturall conſcience being in ſome meaſure convinced, cannot any longer content it ſelfe in ſuch palpable wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe; but by ſome outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or externall reformation this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is caſt forth, as not to be born with any longer. But what comes of it? This <hi>ſame evill ſpirit</hi> comes againe, makes a reentry, dwells there: and in what appearance doth he ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He finds the heart <hi>emptie, ſwept,</hi> &amp; <hi>garniſhed,</hi> with ſome externall forme of religion; and is now exerciſed in ſome excellent performances of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, preaching, hearing, faſting, and the like: and here the ſoule takes much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, in comparing it's preſent actings, with it's former courſes. Yet here is ſeven worſe ſpirits, or the very perfection or myſtery of iniquity; for though theſe garniſhings be never ſo beautifull and glorious; though the outward profeſſion be painted over, and much adorned: yet the evill ſpirit dwells within, the perfection of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, within, the perfection of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, the myſtery of iniquity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſtill in the heart: and this is the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119934:45"/>
higheſt deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the very ſpirit of Antichriſt, and inward actings of the man of ſin.</p>
               <p>Then while we looke abroad in the world, and ſtrike here and there at the externall formes and images of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; let us behold the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt within us, having it's throne and ſeat in our hearts, continually acting of it's parts, in all our duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, in all our worſhips and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: all the blindneſſe, deceit, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and hypocriſie, that lies wrapt up in our hearts, proceeds from this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principle. Therefore it will not be enough, that we cut off the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boughes of outward prophaneneſſe, but that we lay the Axe to the root of the Tree, and deſtroy that ſpirituall wickedneſſe that lies hid within our owne breaſts. Thus much for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and myſtery of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>forme</hi> and appearance of Antichriſt. Now though the ſpirit of Antichriſt, or that corrupt principle in mans heart be the very ſourſe and root of all evill, yet it doth not onely lurk privily in mans heart, but puts it ſelfe forth into the world,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119934:46"/>
openly, and viſible to the eye, and that in many ſeverall formes and figures, in many ſhapes and appearances. Hence it's ſaid, There be <hi>many Antichriſts, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 18. that is, there be many <hi>ſhapes</hi> and <hi>appearances,</hi> in which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall come forth to act his part. Concerning theſe variable ſhapes of the man of ſin, I ſhall now endevour in ſome meaſure to demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>forty two moneths,</hi> notes the various and changeable images of the beaſt: which <hi>terme</hi> of time is the ſame in proportion with the <hi>three dayes and halfe,</hi> mentioned in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. being the time the witneſſes ſhould he dead and ſlaine. I ſhall make uſe of that <hi>terme</hi> of <hi>three dayes and halfe,</hi> in ſtead of the <hi>forty two moneths;</hi> and ſhall ſhew how in each day, and halfe day we have a changeable forme in which Antichriſt doth ſhew himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>terme</hi> of time, or <hi>day</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts <hi>viſible</hi> raigne, was in the ſhape of a <hi>Dragon,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 3. By which we have repreſented to us the Romane Emperours, who uſurped authoritie over the Church and Saints of Chriſt, being very much corrupted,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119934:46"/>
were exceeding great perſecutors and tormentors of all that profeſſed the name of Chriſt. This <hi>great red Dragon,</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ſeven heads, ten hornes,</hi> and <hi>ſeven Crownes;</hi> which doth import the largeneſſe of his Dominion, the greatneſſe of his power and ſtrength. And for his carriage, 'tis <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, who ſought to deſtroy the firſt-borne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and as <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſt, as ſoone as he was borne: ſo this beaſt was ready to devour the child, that the woman was to bring forth. The ſpirituall Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>woman,</hi> as being eſpouſed to Chriſt, and likely to bring forth ſome excellent and worthy inſtrument, as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was ſought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Galerius:</hi> but God taking this child into his own boſome and prorection: and preſerving the woman in the wilderneſſe, from the fury and rage of this Dragon: at laſt raiſing up <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (here called <hi>Michael,</hi> which ſpiritually is meant of Chriſt) to fight againſt <hi>Maxentius, Maximinus,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius:</hi> and overcame them, that they ruled no more in the Roman Empire. Thus thoſe wicked and perſecuting
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119934:47"/>
Emperours, that did ſo much vex and oppreſſe the Saints, are now caſt out of heaven, as not retaining their uſurped authority of the Church. Now the ſubtilty of the Serpent put forth in the cruelty of the Dragon, or corrupt Magiſtracy, acting in ſuch groſſe and abominable wickedneſſe, is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and cryed downe for bloudy tyranny and oppreſſion; ſo that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt could no longer continue in this forme, this his firſt day being ended; and he being caſt to the earth, is forced to ſeek ſome other habit or diſguiſe to appeare in, under ſome fair ſhew or pretence of Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day of Antichriſts pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull raigne, or new forme, that he comes forth in, is in the likeneſſe of a <hi>beaſt,</hi> like unto a <hi>Leopard,</hi> as appeareth from <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
               <p>This beaſt doth prefigure the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Popiſh Empire. Now this univerſall Biſhop came in like an Angel of light, pretending re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and reformation; but intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but hypocriſie and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. This beaſt ariſeth out of the <hi>ſea,</hi> or Nations round about: having
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119934:47"/>
had ſeven heads and ten hornes, as the former beaſt had: and <hi>ten Crownes:</hi> ten kingdomes being ſubjected to the Popiſh Empire; his likeneſſe was like unto a <hi>Leopard,</hi> fierco and cruell; his feet like the feet of a <hi>Beare,</hi> devouring and ravenous; and his mouth as a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> powerfull and mighty. And recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſeat and authority of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. Now this beaſt being exalted in dignity and greatneſſe; and all begin to ſubmit themſelves to his ſervice, and formes of worſhip; crying, <hi>Who is like unto the beaſt?</hi> but now what doth he? Notwithſtanding at the firſt, he pretended to ſanctifie and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet now by degrees he comes to blaſpheme God, his <hi>name, Tabernacle,</hi> and <hi>people;</hi> making warre againſt them, by ſubduing and ſlaying them.</p>
               <p>And thus did this beaſt trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Temple of God, and upon the holy Cities in his moneths and ſeaſons, while they were given into his hand. But the Lord having raiſed up many eminent inſtruments, as <hi>Huſh, Luther, Melancton, Wickcliff, Calvine,</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> with many others, that have reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively according to their light given
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119934:48"/>
forth their teſtimony againſt this beaſt, laying open his hypocriſie and deceit, his filthineſſe and abomination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee hath received ſuch a deadly wound, that it never will be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore is ever ſince upon the declining hand.</p>
               <p>So that now Antichriſt is forced to cloth himſelfe in ſome other dreſſe, and come forth in ſome new habit or diſguiſe to act his part in, and ſo flyes out of the appearance of this beaſt into another.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>day</hi> of Antichriſts power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full raigne, is in the forme of a beaſt with <hi>two hornes like a lamb,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 11. This beaſt doth relate to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and ſuch like formes of pretended reformation; ſo that this appearance carries with it more fair pretences, and greater ſhewes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then the former; and therefore more cloſely hypocriticall and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then the former. This beaſt is ſaid to <hi>ariſe out of the earth,</hi> viz. from a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or earthly power: and had <hi>two hornes,</hi> one was a politicall or civill, the other called Eccleſiaſticall or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: <hi>like a Lamb:</hi> profeſſing much
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119934:48"/>
meekneſſe and gentleneſſe: but ſpeak like a <hi>Dragon,</hi> as being very feirce and cruell; taking upon him to exerciſe the power of the firſt beaſt, to act by humane force, and governe the Church by civill authority: and ſo did but heal up the wound of the former beaſt. And this he doth by lying miracles, as to cauſe <hi>fire to come downe from heaven in the ſight of men;</hi> ſeeming to have the very ſpirit of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> counterfeiting the ſpirit of God in his workings, by which he deceived the people of the earth. But theſe deceits and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of this beaſt being perceived by the Saints of God, he is forced to flee into ſome other forme, to hide himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome other diſguiſe, being cloſely beſet, and driven up into a narrow compaſſe, muſt fly farther for ſuccour and refuge: and is compelled to make ſome other image or pretence, to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelfe. This being the third day.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We have the <hi>halfe day,</hi> in which time we have the <hi>image,</hi> that the laſt beaſt cauſeth to be ſet up, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 14. The beaſt being changed into an <hi>image,</hi> comes forth more refined, moreglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119934:49"/>
in ſhew, pretending the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of all, as being the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge that Antichriſt hath, the laſt <hi>terme</hi> of time he hath to raign, the halfe day, and therefore now he puts on his beſt dreſſe, and cloths himſelfe with his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ornaments. This <hi>halfe day,</hi> and laſt appearance comes neer <hi>Rome</hi> to our owne times; and therefore I ſhall not deſcribe thoſe that ſet up the image of the beaſt, by any proper name; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by theſe ſix particulars follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that we ſhall collect from that place in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. from verſe the 14. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They that ſet up the <hi>image</hi> of the beaſt, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe, that will make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples unto Chriſt by a humane power; and by preſſing ſome externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity upon men, they will convert the world into a Church, and make many to be Chriſtians againſt their wills: and hence it is, that there are ſo many poor, darke, and carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſt. Now this is diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſit to Chriſts rule, who prevailes upon the heart, by meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe, and doth gaine upon the ſoule by truth and righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119934:49"/>
and winne upon the affections with peace and love. Chriſt doth not uſe any coactive or conſtraining power to compell men to be ſubject unto him; but of an unwilling people he makes them willing, by the ſwavity &amp; ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of divine grace, working upon their hearts. But contrarily, theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Church by humane force and worldly power; <hi>cauſing all that will not worſhip the image of the beaſt to be killed.</hi> Thus by force and cruelty they make Diſciples, or rather make many hypocrites, bring many under the force of Religion, that know nothing of the power of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe that cauſe an <hi>image</hi> to be made, they preſcribe rules of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; ſervice, according to their own fancy and invention. Hence it is ſaid, verſ. 15. <hi>They cauſe the image to ſpeake;</hi> That is, by conſtituting and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing platformes of worſhip; advancing their owne devices and directories, above the lawes and inſtitutions of Chriſt. Theſe onely will define what is truth and what not, as comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole myſtery of truth within their ſyſtems or models of divinity:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119934:50"/>
as if they were the onely Ciſternes of living water, and the very oyle that muſt cauſe the lamp to ſhine: making themſelves to be the very treaſury and ſtorehouſe of all wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and thus they ſit down in Chriſts Throne and Temple, officiating his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and authority, robbing him of his dignity and glory, by putting of his crowne upon their own heads.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe cauſe all to worſhip the image, which they ſet up, and by humane force and ſecular power doe compell all men to follow their edicts and platformes; to obſerve their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ordinances, and deviſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It hath been the cuſtome, that the Clergy (ſo called) muſt firſt ſtudy the faith, and afterward the earthly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would confirme it by ſome civill ſanction: and ſo enforce their owne devices upon the conſciences of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Hence it was, that the late Biſhop that ſuffered here in <hi>England,</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe at his death, that he dyed in that Religion, that was eſtabliſhed by law. Now Chriſt doth never call up the powers of the earth to rule and beare ſway in his kingdome. The Lawes by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119934:50"/>
which Chriſt doth rule by, are the law of the <hi>new creature,</hi> and of love, the law of his word and ſpirit: by theſe he doth enforce a ſweet compliance of the heart unto the will of God. The law of Chriſt is moſt heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and it is of the moſt conſtraining force, and of the moſt indiſpenſible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of any law. This is called the law of <hi>liberty,</hi> becauſe it frees the ſoule from the vaſſallage and power of mans deviſes, and brings the ſoule into a reall compliance with the divine will. Thus Chriſt doth change the minde, renew the ſpirit, and alter the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the ſoules of men, and ſo make them ſubject unto his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: while Antichriſt doth enforce many to his kingdome: to yeeld blind obedience unto him, by vertue of ſome humane law, or ſecular power.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, thoſe that undertake to ſet up the <hi>image</hi> of the beaſt, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force ſome <hi>marke</hi> or <hi>badge</hi> to every one, as a token of ſubjection unto their way, or invented forme of worſhip <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 16. Theſe require worſhip and homage of all ſorts, both <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>great:</hi> and cauſe them to receive a <hi>mark

So that theſe give forth ſome Character or mark, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all that come under them, may both be knowne to be of them, and alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Thoſe that erect the <hi>Image</hi> of the beaſt, have not the power of the beaſt, becauſe all they ſet up is but a <hi>ſtatue image, or ſhadow.</hi> We muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the time of the <hi>image</hi> is but the <hi>halfe day,</hi> therefore ſhort: and hence it is, that thoſe that manage the worke, of framing the <hi>image,</hi> are hardly warme in their ſeats; they are no ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, but preſently are throwne down againe from their ſtation. Theſe can but ſtartle and affright men, theſe have but the image of the beaſt, that could devour and deſtroy: Theſe have more will to inflict puniſhment, then they have power to effect: Theſe have the nature and ſpirit of the former beaſt, but not the authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119934:52"/>
This <hi>halfe day</hi> is called the <hi>dividing of a time:</hi> becauſe the Saints are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in bondage under Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes and humane conſtitutions; this image being but as a dead Lyon, that cannot really hurt nor deſtroy; neithr are the Saints wholly free from ſuffring; becauſe they groane under the ſpirit of envie and malice, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and bitterneſſe; and ſuch like perſecutions as theſe, they endure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of the image.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, Thoſe that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the cauſe of the <hi>image,</hi> carry forth the whole worke in the wiſdome, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, power, and ſtrength of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they act all by vertue of fleſhly principles and carnall abilities: They performe all by the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of the beaſt: This is plainly expreſſed in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 17, 18. theſe have his <hi>name,</hi> and the <hi>number</hi> of his <hi>name:</hi> and his number is but the <hi>number of a man,</hi> which amounts to <hi>ſix hundred, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſix.</hi> His number is not the number of <hi>God,</hi> which is <hi>ſeven,</hi> which is a number of <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>reſt.</hi> Chriſt hath the <hi>ſeven ſpirits of God,</hi> being filled with all perfection of wiſdome and

               <p>Firſt, From whom theſe witneſſes receive power to teſtifie againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; that is from the Lord; <hi>I will give power, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:119934:55"/>Secondly, The <hi>title</hi> given unto them; they are called <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their number; they are <hi>two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their office, in which they are to be imployed; <hi>they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, The manner and ſtate, in which they ſhall officiate; that is, in <hi>ſackcloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, The duration and continuance of their propheſie; and that is a <hi>thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing, that we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of, is who doth <hi>impower</hi> theſe witneſſes to performe their office of propheſie; and that is the <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; <hi>I will give</hi> (ſaith the Lord) God gives what the witneſſes have. The Lord doth impower them, to give forth their teſtimony, and none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelfe can inable them for that worke.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall firſt ſhew, who doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the witneſſes to propheſie: and then ſecondly, by what meanes he doth ſo enable them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:119934:55"/>Firſt, The Lord gives forth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of propeeſie, and that two wayes. Firſt, originally from himſelfe: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, mediately by Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The gift of propheſie cometh originally from God himſelfe; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>father of lights, from whom every good gift deſcendeth,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. Hence it is, that thoſe ſpeeches are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in the old Teſtament: <hi>Heare the word of the Lord: Thus ſaith the Lord: and the word of the Lord came unto me,</hi> and the like. All which doth ſignifie, that the Prophets received their prophetical revelations from the Lord. To this purpoſe we may obſerve that phraſe in <hi>Ezek. 20. 46. Son of man, ſet thy face toward the South, and drop thy word toward the South, and propheſie, &amp;c.</hi> And the like ſpeech is that of <hi>Moſes; My doctrine ſhall drop as the raine: my ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſmall raine upon the tender hearb, as the ſhowers upon the graſſe,</hi> Deut. 32. 2. Now from this phraſe of <hi>dropping,</hi> we may argue, that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> had their propheſie from the Lord. For looke as the clouds, from whence raine deſcends
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119934:56"/>
(to mollifie the earth, and to cauſe graſſe and flowers to ſpring) have not their water originally and natively in themſelves, but from the Sea, and moiſtned places of the earth, exhal'd and drawn up by the heat of the Sun: ſo have not the Prophets a ſpirit of propheſie, whereby they of themſelves are able to diſcover divine myſtery and revelation: but it is drawne out of a full ſea of that excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdome, that is in God himſelfe. Then the Prophets muſt of neceſſity receive their meſſage origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from God himſelfe. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, They receive propheſie <hi>mediatly</hi> from Chriſt, unto whom the Lord hath committed the whole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of all things, concerning his Church and kingdome. And we have that paſſage, 1 <hi>Sam. 3. 21. The Lord revealed himſelfe unto Samuel in Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh, by the word of the Lord.</hi> By the word of the Lord is here meant Chriſt, the eternall word, by whom the Lord doth reveale himſelfe, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18. So that Chriſt is brought in by way of mediation, as by whom the Lord ſhould reveale himſelfe. Suitable unto
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119934:56"/>
this is that paſſage in <hi>Geneſ. 19. 24. The Lord rained upon Sodome and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah brimſtone and fire, from the Lord out of heaven.</hi> The Lord raining brimſtone <hi>by the Lord</hi> is meat, that the Lord did adminiſter judgement by Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. Chriſt is here brought forth acting in the office of his mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: though according to his divine nature, he acts immediatly from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, without ſuch dependance or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination: yet I ſay, as Mediator he receives from the father, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates what he receives unto his Saints. Thus you ſee from whom theſe Prophets receive power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; and that's from the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Firſt, from God originally: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from Chriſt as Mediator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by what meanes the Lord doth thus impower theſe Prophets, and that is, firſt, by his word. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is by the word, that theſe Prophets are enabled to give forth their teſtimony. Chriſts Commiſſion to his Diſciples was to <hi>preach the word, Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. And Chriſt is ſayd to <hi>ride proſperouſly on the word of truth,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119934:57"/>
Pſal. 45. 4. John</hi> beares record of the <hi>word</hi> of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 2. The Saints were ſlaine for the <hi>word</hi> of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 11. This <hi>word</hi> is the <hi>ſword, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of Chriſts mouth,</hi> Revel. 1. 16. The word being called the <hi>ſword</hi> of Chriſt; imports, that it is full of effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and power, of great force and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency, diſcerning the thoughts, and ſubduing the imaginations of the heart. This is that ſpirituall weapon, whereby the Saints are able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their enemies, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the evill one, &amp; to teſtifie againſt Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which gives life and power unto the word. The Goſpel is called the <hi>miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. becauſe the Spirit joynes it ſelfe with the word, and makes it a quickning and powerfull word. And therefore it is, that Chriſt ſaith; <hi>My words are ſpirit and life,</hi> Joh. 6. 63. Chriſts word doth not go forth as a dead thing, but as a quickning power; not as a killing letter, but as a powerfull ſpirit. So that the word cannot be ſeparated from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from the word, they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119934:57"/>
both joyntly concur and agree in one: The word is the habit or clothing of the ſpirit, and the ſpirit is the life and power of the word: by theſe meanes, namely, the word and ſpirit, are the witneſſes impowered to propheſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>title</hi> given unto thoſe that teſtifie againſt Antichriſt, they are called <hi>witneſſes.</hi> This appellation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt, being called the <hi>faithfull witnes,</hi> Revel 1. 5. And the <hi>true witneſſe,</hi> Chap. 3. 14. Likewiſe he was promiſed to be given as a <hi>witneſſe to the people, Iſa.</hi> 55. 4. Therefore he tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he came into the world, to beare <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the truth,</hi> Joh. 18. 37. In like manner are the Saints called <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> as being called forth to teſtifie of the will &amp; minde of God before the world. Thus it was ſayd of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> that he was ſent as a <hi>witneſſe of the light,</hi> Joh. 1. 7. <hi>And to him</hi> (meaning to Chriſt) <hi>gave all the Prophets witneſſe,</hi> Act. 10. 43. The Saints that ſuffered for Chriſt, ſuffered for the <hi>witneſſe of Jeſus,</hi> Revel. 20. 4. There is one place where by the Prophet, both Chriſt and the Saints are brought in as joynt witneſſes; where the Lord ſpeaking of his people
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119934:58"/>
ſayth; <hi>Ye are my witneſſes:</hi> and ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, farther ſaith, <hi>And my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that I have choſen,</hi> Eſa. 43. 10. So that as Chriſt doth receive a meſſage from the Father, he doth truly and faithfully give forth his teſtimony, as appeares in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 32. So alſo the Saints that receive his word, and declare their teſtimony of his truth, do ſet to their ſeal, and witneſſe of the truth, as it is in Jeſus, and doe give forth teſtimony thereof before the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>number</hi> of theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and they are <hi>two.</hi> Some ſay, that there are onely <hi>two</hi> eminent perſons here meant, not exceeding the number expreſſed. Others, that thereby are meant the two Teſtaments, &amp; ſo make the Scripture to be the witneſſe here ſpoken of: or elſe <hi>two</hi> in regard of their <hi>types,</hi> which are preſented to us by <hi>paires,</hi> as <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the two <hi>anoynted ones:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> that cauſed fire to come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> by whom the water in Aegypt was turned into bloud, as we ſhall underſtand more in the ſequell. Or more eſpecially, they are called <hi>two</hi> witneſſes, in proportion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119934:58"/>
to the Law, that would not take an accuſation, unleſſe aſſerted by <hi>two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> Matth. 18. 16. So here becauſe there ſhall be a ſufficient teſtimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth againſt Antichriſt, by the faithfull witneſſes of Chriſt, they are called <hi>two,</hi> as moſt compleat and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6. Thus you have their number, they are <hi>two Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their <hi>office</hi> and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows. They <hi>Propheſie.</hi> Now in that they are ſtiled <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and doe <hi>Propheſie:</hi> wee are to conſider two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, What we are to underſtand here by <hi>Propheſie.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, What is the teſtimony they give forth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>By <hi>Propheſie,</hi> wee may underſtand three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to <hi>propheſie,</hi> it is to foretell things to come, to declare things that ſhall come to paſſe: according to that ſaying in <hi>Eſa 42. 9. Behold former things are come to paſſe, and new things doe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; before they ſpring forth, I tell you of them.</hi> Now though this be chiefly meant of Chriſt, yet it is foretold by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119934:59"/>
the Prophet, as being firſt revealed to him. So that propheſie is a dlvine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or a foretelling of things to come, by a heavenly revelation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to <hi>propheſie,</hi> ſometimes is meant of underſtanding the myſtery of propheſie, or of ſuch things, as are foreſpoken of: as to open and declare the myſtery of truth from divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies. And in this reſpect the Saints under the new Teſtament are called <hi>Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 29. Theſe were not ſo called, in relation to any divine predictions, that they could declare; but rather from that dexterity &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe they had to interpret and open the myſtery of thoſe truths propheſied of before. From ſuch gifts as theſe, were they called <hi>Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to <hi>Propheſie,</hi> is when belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by their experience can give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the fulfilling of propheſies. And thus thoſe primitive Saints were ſayd to propheſie; when the propheſie of <hi>Joel</hi> was fulfilled in them, and they were able by experience to teſtifie of the truth foreſpoken of: <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16, 17. where it's ſayd; <hi>I will powre out my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon all fleſh, and your ſonnes and your
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119934:59"/>
daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe by an alluſion to the former manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of God to the Prophets, are ſaid to propheſie, becauſe by a divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of truth, and glorious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of grace upon their hearts, they could by experience ſay, this day is the Scripture fulfilled, and the grace of the propheſie powred forth upon us. So beholding the viſion of divine grace, they are ſayd to <hi>propheſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In each of theſe ſences the Saints under the raigne of Antichriſt, may be ſayd to <hi>propheſie.</hi> Firſt, from a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall inſpiration and glorious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of heavenly things: they are able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oretell, and propheſie, that Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon ſhall fall: This is their meſſage: and this they teſtifie continually. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They by a ſpirituall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and apprehenſion of the things of God, are able to underſtand enigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and difficult things; and make glorious diſcoveries of the myſteries of truth, and alſo of the myſteries of Antichriſt. Thirdly, in every age, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their light and experience, they give forth a teſtimony, of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of thoſe propheſies, both of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119934:60"/>
raigne and ruine of Antichriſt. And thus the Witneſſes are ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the <hi>teſtimony</hi> that they give forth, and that is, they hold forth the truth and authoritie of Chriſt, againſt the falſhood and uſurpation of Antichriſt. Theſe witneſſes give forth a double teſtimony.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, againſt the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, againſt the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>beaſt.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, they teſtifie againſt the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the Serpent, by holding forth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grace of Chriſt; whereby he ſhould break the head of the Serpent, as it was foretold in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Chriſt tooke the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was clothed with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was made fleſh, and came forth in our habit and forme; became <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> God with us, or in our fleſh; but ſo filled with heavenly anoyntings, and ſo clothed with the divine nature, that he was able to ſubdue Satan, and to tread him under his feet, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to breake the head of this <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> and to caſt him forth into the earth. Thus the Apoſtle teſtified to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119934:60"/>
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>the God of peace ſhould bruiſe Satan under their feet,</hi> Rom. 16. 20. By yertue of that Evangelicall promiſe, Chriſt ſhould overcome and cruſh the curſed ſeed of the Serpent. Of this the witneſſes doe teſtiſie, by holding forth Chriſt to be the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the woman: in whom dwelt the anoynting, by which all wickedneſſe is ſubdued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They teſtifie againſt the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>beaſt:</hi> and that is, by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the office &amp; dignity of Chriſt, againſt the power, government, rule, &amp; dominion of Antichriſt; for though he acknowledge verbally, that Chriſt hath the ſole power and government in his Church, yet vertually he doth deny it; by uſurping thoſe dignities and offices to himſelfe. The teſtimony that the Saints doe eſpecially give out againſt the rule and domination of Antichriſt, is of the <hi>propheſie, Prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>kingdome</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the <hi>propheſie</hi> of Chriſt; they acknowledge Chriſt to be the <hi>great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> of his Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 37. To be the great Doctor &amp; teacher of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; according to that expteſſion in <hi>Cant. 5. 13. His lips like L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es, dropping
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119934:61"/>
ſweet ſmelling myrrb:</hi> By Chriſts lips are meant his divine propheſies and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly teachings, by which he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct teachings, his people: his words are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull as the <hi>lilie,</hi> and odoriferous as <hi>myrrhe.</hi> Now the Saints holding forth the ſufficiency and power of Chriſts teachings, doe overthrow the fleſhly wiſdome, carnall knowledge, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teachings of Antichriſt: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Lord hath ſaid; <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the wiſdome of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 19. And the Apoſtle tells us in <hi>verſ. 27, 28. That God hath choſen the poore, weake, and deſpiſed things of the world, to bring to nought things that were high and mighty.</hi> Hence it is, that we have that ſaying of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 6, 7. We ſpeake wiſdome to them that are perfect,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet not the wiſdome of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, that come to nought; but we ſpeake the wiſdome of God in a myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. By them that are perfect, the Apoſtle meaneth, thoſe that are of full age, that are men in underſtanding of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine myſteries: ſo that his preaching was wiſdome to the wiſe: but it was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119934:61"/>
not humane wiſdome, ſuch as the world accounted of; nor politi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ll wiſdome of Princes; but a hidden and ſecret wiſdome; a divine myſtery of heavenly wiſdome, ſuch as the reaſon and underſtanding of carnall men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach or comprehend. And thus theſe witneſſes teſtifying of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie and wiſdome of Chriſt, doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the wiſdome and underſtanding of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They teſtifie of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt: acknowledging him to be the eternall Prieſt of God, ſet over the <hi>houſe of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 21. And that he is a Prieſt after the <hi>order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec,</hi> Heb. 7. 11, 12. And not after the manner of <hi>Aaron,</hi> therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, there is a <hi>change of the Law.</hi> So that hereby they give a teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Jewiſh rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that Antichriſt doth ſet up, and enforce an obſervation of. And thus the Apoſtle doth teſtifie againſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, when he ſayth; <hi>If ye be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I teſtifie to every man, that is circumciſed, that he is a debtor to the whole law: and Chriſt is become of none
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119934:62"/>
effect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. That which is here ſaid of Circumciſion, is true of all other Levicicall rites: if men will Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize and ſtick now to Moſaicall rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chriſt will be unprofitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, for they are againe enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and bound to keep the whole law: and if they will be juſtified by ſuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall obſervations, then Chriſt ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile them nothing; they hold not the head, when they cleave to ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. They that will againe ſet up the Pedigogie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and bring men under Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icall rites and ceremonies; theſe doe in effect deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, and therefore are of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; according to that Text, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2, 3. So that the Saints bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, doe oppoſe Antichriſt in all his legall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, they teſtifie of the <hi>kingdome</hi> of Chriſt: and doe antri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all headſhip, power, rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to Chriſt; they make him alone to be <hi>coput eccleſiae,</hi> the ſupreame head of his Church; and ridiculous is the Popes challenge to be the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall head; whereas Chriſt hath not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119934:62"/>
inſtituted any ſuch image of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The witneſſes doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the whole dominion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be upon Chriſts owne ſhoulders, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9. 6. he alone to have the ſoveraigne power and authority in governing of his Church, he onely to have the ſupremacy of Regiment. Hereby the witneſſes doe teſtifie againſt the authority, power, and domination, that Antichriſt doth exerciſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Cannon lawes, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtitutions, that he doth ſet up. Great hath been then ſurpation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt in this kinde, he undertakes to rule over the ſoules and conſciences of men; one of the chiefeſt of all <hi>Babylons</hi> merchandizes, are the <hi>ſoules of men,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 18. 13. But this practice was never tollerated by Chriſt. Antichriſt doth rule by an earthly and humane power; accordingly we have it expreſſed in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 1, 2. That the <hi>kings of the Earth committed fornication with the whore:</hi> that is, by joyning their power with her; they give up their power to uphold her intereſt, for this who riſh woman doth <hi>ride on the beaſt,</hi> verſ. 7. The woman is the Antichriſtian ſtate,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119934:63"/>
riding upon the powers of the world, in the forme of a beaſt, unto whom the kings give their power. So that when Antichriſt, and the kings of the earth have mixed and knit cheir power toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that kingdome, or that Empire, that doth uphold the power of the whore, becomes as a beaſt, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to her, yeilding unto her all their ſtrength and dominion. Then the power of States and Kingdomes, thus begotten and brought forth by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fornication, is but a falſe and whoriſh power, a corrupted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting power; by which meanes the idolatrous woman becomes drunken with the bloud of the Saints, and of the Martyrs of Jeſus. Now the Saints giving teſtimony of the kingdome and dominion of Chriſt, doe oppoſe all the falſe and tyrannicall powers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. And thus we have deſcribed, what is the propheſie of the witneſſe; and the teſtimony that they give forth.</p>
               <p>Fiſtly, we are to conſider the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> in which theſe witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and that is in <hi>ſackcloth.</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in <hi>ſackcloth,</hi> denotes that ſad and mournfull condition of the witneſſes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119934:63"/>
under the power and raigne of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Thus ſackcloth and mourning is ſet forth as a badge or ſigne of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſtreſſe, in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 30. and <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 10. This ſtate of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes doth hold forth unto us theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the witneſſes give out their teſtimony in a poor, weak, low, and deſpicable way; there being in ſome meaſure the abſence of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome; according to that ſpeech of Chriſt, in <hi>Matth. 9. 15. When the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome ſhall be taken away, they ſhall mourn.</hi> So that the reaſon why the witneſſes mourne, and put on ſackcloth, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a great meaſure the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome is abſent, and at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and they in a very ſad, weak and meane condition; and they doe but <hi>propheſie,</hi> or foretell things to come, beholding things a far off, and not fully enjoying that glory, that they propheſie of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it imports, that their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> were under reſtraint and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The beaſt alwayes making warre with them, by fines, impriſonment, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and death; they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119934:64"/>
under perſecution, trouble and vexation, all the time of the raigne and dominion of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it argues, that their <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> was alwayes rejected, caſt forth, and trampled under foot. The world hath alwayes ſlighted and caſt off the reſtimony of the witneſſes, as of old the <hi>Jewes</hi> did neglect the teſtimony of Chriſt, of whom it is ſaid; <hi>No man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his teſtimony,</hi> Job. 3. 32. So that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> cannot but mourne and lament, as it were in ſackcloth, when their bridegroome is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure abſent, when their perſons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and their teſtimony rejected. Thus much for their ſtate, being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in <hi>ſackcloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, the <hi>duration</hi> and continuance of their propheſie: and that is a <hi>thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore dayes.</hi> In the former verſe, when we opened the <hi>terme of forty two moneths</hi> (accounting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

1260 dayes. The woman nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the wilderneſſe, 1260 dayes. The <hi>terme</hi> mentioned by <hi>Daniel, A time, times, and halfe a time.</hi> The witneſſes lie ſlaine <hi>three dayes and a halfe:</hi> all theſe <hi>termes</hi> of time hold one and the ſame proportion. So that the witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying 1260 dayes, is meant, they ſhall propheſie the whole time of the viſible raigne of Antichriſt, in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. But here we may note, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts time is counted by <hi>moneths,</hi> which are reckoned by the courſe of the Moon, unconſtant and changeable: and it ſhews forth thus much, that all the worſhips, formes, and actions of Antichriſt are brought forth by a weak and dim light, a light borrowed from the Sun, they are workes of darkneſſe and of the night, wherein the Moone ruleth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 16. It is not a light of the Sun, it ariſeth not from Chriſt, it ſhineth not immediatly from the Lord. But on the contrary, the propheſie of the witneſſes is accounted by <hi>dayes:</hi> a <hi>day</hi> is meaſured by the <hi>Sun,</hi> as a <hi>moneth</hi> is by the <hi>Moone;</hi> and notes, that it is a <hi>day time,</hi> more conſtant, more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and full of light, as appeares in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119934:65"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. The true ſervants of Chriſt are brought out of darkneſſe into <hi>light;</hi> and are children of the <hi>day,</hi> and of the <hi>light;</hi> and therefore it is, their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is meaſured out, not by <hi>moneths,</hi> but by <hi>dayes.</hi> But however the witneſſes time is accounted by <hi>dayes;</hi> it holds the ſame proportion of time with <hi>forty two moneths;</hi> that ſo long as Antichriſt ſhall raigne and domineer, ſo long ſhall the witneſſes propheſie in ſackcloth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually powering forth their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the wickedneſſe of the man of ſin. So much for the <hi>time</hi> of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes propheſſe.</p>
               <p>Having opened the words, give me leave now to draw forth ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Obſerve, <hi>That none can give</hi>

Chriſt himſelfe, the great and faithfull witneſſe, ſaith, <hi>As the Father hath ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeake,</hi> Joh. 12. 50. Thus we have the Apoſtle ſpeaking in 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 5. This is the meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you:</hi> The ſervants of Chriſt can onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119934:65"/>
what they have received of him, and that upon the ſureſt evidence, and cleareſt demonſtration. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>What we have heard and ſeen, we declare unto you,</hi> ver. 3. So that onely thoſe that receive from the Lord a gift, a revelation, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall underſtanding, ſuch onely are able to give forth a teſtimony of Chriſt and of his truth. Theſe witneſſes can admoniſter the things of God, ſuitably to what they have received of the gift or meaſure of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>That all thoſe that</hi>

Therefore every individuall Saint, that doth according to his meaſure and ability, either by preaching, praying, writing, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, hold forth the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119934:66"/>
of Chriſt, againſt the uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tyranny of Antichriſt, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, of what quality or degree ſoever, the ſame is a <hi>witneſſe</hi> of Chriſt, to teſtifie againſt the man of ſin, that wicked one, that ſon of perdition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>That the witneſſe</hi>

That is, becauſe of their obdurate malice and incredulity, ſhutting their eyes againſt the truth, that was ſufficiently held forth by theſe witneſſes; therefore the Lord would blinde their eyes, by a reſtraint of his grace, and wholly give them up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to captivate their mindes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

their underſtandings, that they ſhould beleeve lying &amp; falſe doctrines, to take pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe, ſo as by their prodigious lies, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſuperſtitions, they ſhould mightily oppoſe the truth.</p>

The teſtimony they give forth, is, that the power of the anointing, in the anointed, ſhall ſubdue the ſeed of the Serpent; and that Chriſt, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King, ſhall overcome the wiſdome, worſhip, and dominion of the beaſt. Thus they propheſie, and continually powre forth their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, bearing witneſſe unto the truth; this is their meſſage they have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and they make it their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtudy and practice, faithfully to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this meſſage and truſt. Thus Chriſt tells <hi>Pilate; For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>came I into the world, to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the truth,</hi> Joh. 18. 37. This was Chriſts worke and buſineſſe; and this
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119934:67"/>
is the great arrand and embaſſage of all his people, to beare witneſſe of the truth, and to ſet to their ſcales that Chriſt is true: and that Antichriſt is a lier, a ſeducer, full of untruth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Obſerve, <hi>Thoſe that have been</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>most faithfull unto Chriſt and his truth, have been moſt rejected of the world.</hi> Theſe witneſſes being perſecuted in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and flighted in their teſtimony, they are made to mourne, and put on ſackcloth. Thus it was with Chriſt, while he was on earth, he did as it were propheſie in ſackcloth; being <hi>rejected</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and deſpiſed of men,</hi> was a man of <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and griefe;</hi> his teſtimony was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; his words contradicted; his perſon ſet at nought; and all becauſe he did teſtifie of the truth. The ſame meaſure is given forth to all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants; the true ground of all their ſufferings, is the teſtimony they give forth, for bearing witneſſe unto the truth. The ſoules under the Altar were ſlaine for the <hi>teſtimony that they held,</hi> Revel. 6. 9. <hi>Sackcloth</hi> and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have been the portion of all ſuch as witneſſed the truth, in the time of

the powerfull raigne of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, Obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>hath alwayes had a people to beare witneſſe of his truth, even in the ſaddeſt and darkeſt time of Antichriſts raigne.</hi> The time of the witneſſes propheſie in ſackcloth, is as long as the time, as the man of ſin hath to trample under the <hi>holy Citie.</hi> Though the times werenever ſo dark, and perſecutions never ſo cruell, yet ſtill there was alwayes a remnant, that were neither ſo farre blinded, nor ſo much diſcouraged, as to give out, as that they ſhould withhold their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto the truth. When <hi>Elijah</hi> thought he had been left alone, the Lord had preſerved to himſelfe ſeven thouſand, that had not <hi>bowed the knee to Baal, nor kiſſed him,</hi> I King. 19. 18. So all the time of the generall apoſtacie and defection, under the man of ſin, the Lord hath reſerved to himſelfe, ſuch as he hath kept from the evill of the time, that would not yeeld to the worſhip, nor conforme to the idolatrous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Antichriſt.</p>

               <p>HAving already ſpoken of the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, title, number,</hi> and <hi>office</hi> of theſe witneſſes, alſo of the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of them in their <hi>office:</hi> now we are led to enquire who they are; of whom in this fourth verſe, we have a ſufficient draught and ful deſcription.</p>
               <p>Before I come to declare poſitively who theſe witneſſes are, I ſhall firſt ſhew you what the various opinions of men are in this thing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There are thoſe that would have theſe two witneſſes, to be meant of the <hi>two Teſtaments,</hi> which they call Law and Goſpel, namely, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but this interpretation is too remote from the adequate ſence and meaning of the place; for theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are brought in as men, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated by men, that are brought in as their types, and are deſcribed by ſuch actions that they ſhould performe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119934:68"/>
the world: therefore, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the Scriptures are the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> that theſe witneſſes give forth, but not the <hi>witneſſes</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others underſtand the two witneſſes to be meant of Godly <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> and Godly <hi>Miniſters:</hi> viz. two eminent ranks of men: of the ſame quality as <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were of. Now though this interpretation doth beare ſome <hi>Analogie</hi> and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the truth; the text cannot be ſo reſtrained; for thoſe two eminent types did rather prefigure Chriſt, who is here brought in, as the great wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, meant by the two Olive trees, as will appeare by the ſequell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Chriſt be chiefly perſonated by <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> there is then no neceſſity to reſtraine the witneſſes to perſons of the ſame quality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some hold that theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are meant of <hi>two eminent</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar perſons, that the Lord ſhould raiſe up, for ſome great and ſpeciall deſigne of his; to performe ſome mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and glorious work: and then to be bodily ſlaine by the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119934:69"/>
partie: but neither will this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation be congruous to the ſence of the place; for the witneſſes are not meant of any eminent perſons, that the Lord ſhould raiſe up at any one time or age of Antichriſt, to give forth a teſtimony of the truth; but it holds forth all thoſe that ſhould teſtifie of Chriſt, in all the whole time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts raigne; as was plainly ſhewed from the former verſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, another ſort doth conclude, that the witneſſes can be meant of none, but of ſuch as have ſuffered <hi>martyrdome,</hi> &amp; ſpilt their bloud for the teſtimony unto the truth. I doe neither condemne, nor contradict the truth of this interpretation; for moſt certaine it is, that thoſe that layed downe their lives for the profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, were great and eminent witneſſes of the truth; but we may not reſtraine theſe witneſſes here, to be meant onely of ſuch; becauſe there be many that give forth large te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Jeſus Chriſt; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer naturall death for ſo doing.

ſlaying, but of a myſticall; and of ſuch a ſlaying that many ſhall ſuffer, that never come to lay downe their lives for Chriſt; as we ſhall come to ſee more fully by the conſequent of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>Now to declare poſitively and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who are the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> here meant, and they are <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Saints;</hi> who make up but one ſpirituall body; and though they may be diſtinguiſhed as head and members; yet cannot be ſeperated, no more then the branch from the vine. Now that Chriſt and his Saints are here meant will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the deſcription, that the Text it ſelfe makes of them.</p>
               <q>Theſe are the two Olive trees, and the two Candleſticks, ſtanding before the God of the earth.</q>
               <p>It will be neceſſary for the opening of theſe words, to ſhew;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who is meant by the <hi>two Olive trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Who is ſignified by the <hi>two Candleſticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Why they are called <hi>two.</hi> Fourthly, How Chriſt can be here meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:119934:70"/>If the queſtion be asked; who are the <hi>two Olive trees?</hi> The anſwer may be made from <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. from whence the deſcription of theſe witneſſes is fetcht: <hi>Theſe are the two anointed ones, &amp;c.</hi> That Chriſt is here meant by the two Olive branches, will appeare by their deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe two <hi>Olive trees</hi> are ſayd to be placed on the <hi>right ſide,</hi> and on the <hi>left ſide</hi> of the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> Zach. 4. 11. This repreſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s us with Chriſt, with both the armes of his two natures embracing, comforting, and bleſſing of his people.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt, as taking our nature, fulfilling all righteouſneſſe, ſuffering temptations, dying upon the Croſſe, herein diſcovers himſelfe to be a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Mediator, a compaſſionate high Prieſt, and a comfortable Saviour to ſinning ſoules. And thus Chriſt is the Olive branch on the <hi>left ſide</hi> of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt, as being filled with the fulneſſe of God, clothed with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, compleat in grace, anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſpirit; and as a head gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving downe an influence into all the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119934:70"/>
parts and members; and as the root ſending forth vertue and life into all the branches: alwayes communicating of his ſulneſſe and redundancy of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace into the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whereby he doth fill them with righteouſneſſe, love, and peace: hereby he is as the Olive tree on the <hi>right ſide</hi> of the Candleſticke. Suitable unto this is that phraſe in <hi>Cant. 2.6. His left hand is under my head; and his right hand doth embrace me.</hi> As if the Church had ſayd; Chriſt, my beloved, doth comfort, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, and refreſh mee with both the armes of his two natures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe two olive trees, are ſaid to <hi>emptie</hi> the golden oyle out of themſelves, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 12. Now it is to much for men, of what ranke or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever; to <hi>emptie oyle</hi> out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for all men, the beſt of men, all as meer men take oyle into themſelves. Its onely Chriſt, the true branch, that ſpringeth out of the everlaſting root, that by a continuall flowing and iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of ſpirituall life and grace, doth abundantly ſupply all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the Angel asked <hi>Zachary,</hi> ſaying; <hi>What ſeeſt thou?</hi> he anſwered,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119934:71"/>
                  <hi>I beheld a Candleſtick all of gold, with a bowle upon the top of it, and ſeven lamps thereon, and ſeven pipes to the ſeven lamps, &amp;c. Zach.</hi> 4. 2. The Candleſtick was a chiefe utenſill in the Temple, which doth repreſent unto us the myſticall Candleſtick of the Church; the <hi>bowle</hi> above it, is meant of Chriſt, who hath received all fullneſſe of the ſpirit from their Father, ſignified by the <hi>oyle,</hi> which being preſſed out of the true olive tree, as a moſt lively ſpring doth iſſue forth its ſtreames unto all his Saints. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lamps, or powerfull operations of his Spirits, in life and ſpirituall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth give it ſelfe forth by the <hi>ſeven pipes,</hi> or ſeverall diſpenſations to all his members. Thus Chriſt is the fat Olive tree, that empties forth the oyle of divine grace, into the Candleſtick, <hi>viz.</hi> his Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe are deſcribed to be, the <hi>two anointed ones of God:</hi> Zach. 4. 14. Theſe <hi>two anointed ones</hi> are called in the Hebrew, <hi>the ſonnes of oyle;</hi> becauſe it<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> was the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to anoint three ſorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> Prophets, Prieſts, and Kings; Theſe here in the ext are meant of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbua,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:119934:71"/>
who were but types of Chriſt, and of thoſe that the Lord ſhould make his anointed ones.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was a chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and head in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the firſt that was carried away captive into <hi>Babylon;</hi> and one of the firſt that returned; and was one of the chiefe rebuilders of the Temple; as appeares <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 2. His hands laid the firſt ſtone, and the laſt ſtone in that edifice or building. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is repreſented unto us Chriſt the chiefe head and governour of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: firſt carried captive into ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and firſt returning, working his owne deliverance, and the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairer of his Church or new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe hand ſhall at length finiſh the Temple of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Joſhua</hi> the high Prieſt, was the other <hi>anointed one:</hi> upon whoſe head was a fair <hi>Mitre,</hi> or Prieſtly ornament; unto whom was promiſed, that he ſhould judge the Lords houſe, and keep his Courts: that the Lords would put the whole miniſtry and ſervice of his houſe and Temple into his hand. All this doth but povnt out Chriſt; for ſaith the Lord in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Behold I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119934:72"/>
will ſend forth my ſervant the Branch:</hi> a frequent appellation given to the Meſſias; who was to be that eminent high Prieſt over the houſe of God, that the whole government and miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things ſhould be in the hand of Chriſt, and that himſelfe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually miniſter in the holy things of God. Then without queſtion, <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> the chiefe governour, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> the high Prieſt; theſe <hi>anointed ones,</hi> were eminent types of Chriſt, who was the anointed King and Prieſt over his Church; into whoſe hands, God hath put the judgement and adminiſtration of all things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, Theſe <hi>two olive trees</hi> are ſaid to <hi>ſtand by the Lord of the whole earth.</hi> Now there is none that ſtands by the Lord of the whole earth but Chriſt himſelfe; as appeares by that place, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 21. The Lord ſpeaking by an Angel to <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſaith; <hi>I will ſhew thee, that which is noted in the Scripture of truth: and there was none that boldeth with me</hi> (or ſtrengtheneth himſelfe) <hi>in theſe things, but Michael your Prince.</hi> The Lord had threatened to fight with the Prince of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and therefore ſaith to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119934:72"/>
                  <hi>Daniel,</hi> I will ſhew thee, that which is noted in the <hi>Scripture of truth:</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a figurative ſpeech, doth mean the determinate counſell and minde of God: and that none ſtrengtheneth himſelfe, <hi>but Michael the Prince:</hi> as if he had ſaid: There is no humane force or power whereby I will ſuſtaine my ſelfe, but by <hi>Michael,</hi> the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince, Leader, and chiefe Conductor of his people.</p>
               <p>To ſtand by the Lord of the whole earth, notes theſe four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar onely to Chriſt; according to that of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith; <hi>God hath exalted him, and given him a name</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>above every name,</hi> Phil. 2. 9. Chriſt in taking our nature made himſelfe of no reputation, or as the word ſignifieth, he <hi>evacuated</hi> himſelfe, he did as it were exhauſt and draw himſelfe dry, denud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtripping himſelfe of all his glory: but now in his exaltation, ſtanding before the Lord, his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and glory doth ſhine forth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It notes <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength;</hi> for to ſtand before the Lord, is all one with ſitting at Gods right hand, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119934:73"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11. Gods right hand in Scripture is taken Metonymically for <hi>ſtrength,</hi> whereby Chriſt is enabled to uphold and protect his people; and to diſſipate and ſcatter all his enemies; as having all things ſubjected under his feet. Hence it is ſaid, He ſtandeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of the <hi>earth.</hi> God is called the <hi>God of heaven,</hi> Dan. 2. 18. Here he is called the <hi>God of the carth:</hi> noteing, that though Antichriſt ſeemeth to bear all the ſway in the world, yet Chriſt hath the rule and world, yet Chriſt hath rule and power of things in the earth, and he rules in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of men, and that he interpoſeth and meddles in all ſecular affaires, in order to his owne kingdome, and to the preſervation of his owne people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It notes the actuall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the kingdome of God, to be put into the hands of Chriſt; for the Father hath <hi>loved him, put all things into his hand,</hi> Joh. 3. 35. And in reſpect of the <hi>diſpenſatory</hi> part of the kingdome of God, the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son, <hi>John.</hi> 5. 22. And hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him over his owne houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119934:73"/>
So that Chriſt by ſtanding before the Lord, is impowered to ſubject the hearts of men to himſelfe, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his people, to counſell and direct, to govern and protect them: and alſo to tread upon the necke and power of his adverſries, confounding their plots, and deſtroying of their perſons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To <hi>ſtand before the Lord of the whole earth,</hi> acceptation and delight, to be as it were alwayes in the eye and heart of God; and this priviledge is eminently attributed to Chriſt, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23, 24, &amp;c. <hi>The Lord Poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his workes of old:</hi> the phraſe of <hi>beginning</hi> is put for eternity, <hi>a parte ame,</hi> as we ſay, as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, even from eternity, before the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, I was my fathers darling: for <hi>when he made the heavens, girded the ſea and gave the unreſiſtible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; that it ſhould keepe it's bounds: I was as one brought up with him, I was as a child with the father: I was daily his delight.</hi> The Hebrew word is in the plurall<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> number, <hi>delights;</hi> intimating that Chriſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119934:74"/>
was the greateſt delights of the father; he was variety of delights unto him: in ſo much that while God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the world, he took ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, that he made all things <hi>by him:</hi> that is, he made all things, as bearing ſome analogy or proportion of him: So that every creature hath ſome Character, ſome inſcription or ſhadow of his excellency upon it. Againe, he addeth; <hi>I was alwayes rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before him.</hi> In the Hebrew it is, <hi>ſporting greatly:</hi> the phraſe being a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, or ſimile, taken from little children that ſport and play before their parents: Thus Chriſt is alwayes <hi>ſtanding before the Lord,</hi> being his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall delight, his joy and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; as alwayes in his eye and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee plainly, who is meant by the <hi>two olive trees;</hi> namely, Chriſt, who ſtandeth on the right ſide, and on the left ſide of the Candleſtick, empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oyle out of himſelfe, being the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed one of God, ſtanding by the Lord of the whole earth. Now it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that we ſhew who are meant by the <hi>two Candleſticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:119934:74"/>The <hi>two Candleſticks</hi> doe repreſent unto us the Saints and ſervants of Chriſt, the whole number of Churches and beleevers; and this will appeare if we conſider ſome particulars in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe Candleſticks.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe receive oyle into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as the olive trees doe emptie oyle out of themſelves; ſo the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks receive in oyle into themſelves As it was ſaid of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment powered upon his head, ran downe to the skirts of his garment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 2. Alluding to that fragrant oyntment made of ſo many precious ingredients, mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 23. So Chriſt being filled with heavenly and divine anointings, that all his members receive of his fulneſſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. They receive an <hi>unction from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One, I Joh.</hi> 2. 20. There is in Chriſt, <hi>plenitudo redundantie,</hi> a fulneſs of redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, and everlaſting ſpring of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace, continually flowing, forth upon all his people, whereby they are <hi>filled with the fullneſſe of God,</hi> Eph. 3. 19. and are repleniſhed with a perfect ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of light and life. Thus the Saints are made the anointed ones of God,

by receiving the golden oyle into themſelves: though it be true, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as it were, at ſecond hand, as through a Mediator; Chriſt having firſt received of his father, all fullneſſe of divine grace, doth abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to all that are his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe Candleſticks were ſayd to be made of pure gold, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 12. According to the deſcription we finde in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 31. which denotes the purity and righteouſneſſe of the Saints. Chriſt himſelfe is ſayd to be a head of gold, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. Suitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head are all the members. The righteouſneſſe and ſanctity of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, doth much excell the excellency and righteouſneſſe: of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> even as gold doth excell other mettals. Gold is the moſt ſolid, pure, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mettall of all other: by which is repreſented, the ſound, pure, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting grace &amp; holineſſe of the Saints: they are not made up of droſſe or any earthly excellency of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> but of the pure and undefiled, of the precious and permanent, of the divine and heavenly nature and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:119934:76"/>Thirdly, Theſe <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> are meant of the Churches and Saints of God; in as much as Chriſt is ſayd to walke and appeare in the middeſt of them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 13. Chriſt by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. preſence with his Saints, doth teach, guide, and uphold them: and by his wiſdome, providence and power, doth mightily preſerve them, in the middeſt of feares and dangers. As the Candleſtick of it ſelfe, is not ſufficient to give forth light; no more can the Saints ſhine forth in heavenly bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but as they receive all their light and ſhine from Chriſt, who is to them as oyle to the lampe, and by his owne ſpirit, life, and light, doth cauſe them to ſhine forth in ſpirituall happineſſe and glory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the Saints as Candleſticks hold forth the light and glory of God, before the men of the world. Thus the Apoſtle doth exhort the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that by ſincerity and holineſſe, they would ſhine forth as lights, among the perverſe ſonnes of men; and therefore ſaith; <hi>That ye may be blameleſſe and harmleſſe, the Sonnes of God, without rebuke in the middeſt of a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119934:77"/>
crooked and perverſe Nation; among whom ye ſhine as light. John Baptiſt</hi> was ſayd to <hi>beare witneſſe of the light,</hi> Joh. 1. 7. And therefore called <hi>a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> Joh. 5. 35. His doctrine was as a fire <hi>burning;</hi> and his converſation as a light <hi>ſhining</hi> among all thoſe he was converſant with; alwayes giving forth an ample teſtimony of Chriſt, bearing witneſſe, that he was the true light, enlightening all, that by him ſhould come into the world.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee who are meant by the <hi>two Candleſticks,</hi> the Saints of the moſt high, who receive oyle into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as gold, they appeare in righteouſneſſe, being by Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence continually fed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupply of grace, whereby they ſhine forth as glorious lights, alwayes being ready to give forth a teſtimony of the grace and truth of Chriſt, before the men of the world.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, having ſhewed, that Chriſt the great and faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is reſembled by the <hi>two olive trees,</hi> emptying oyle out of himſelfe into the Churches; ſignified by two Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, whereby they become the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119934:77"/>
ones of God, ſtanding before the Lord of the whole earth, and beare witneſſe unto the truth. Now it next followeth, that we ſhew, why they are called <hi>two</hi> olive trees; and <hi>two</hi> Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks. But firſt, why Chriſt is called <hi>two</hi> olive trees. And that's in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, From his <hi>two fold nature.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, From his <hi>two fold diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is called <hi>two</hi> olive trees, in reſpect of his twofold nature; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his <hi>humane,</hi> and <hi>divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt according to his <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> tooke on him the very ranke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of men; as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, that he tooke the <hi>forme of a ſervant, and was ſound,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the ſimilitude and ſhape of men:</hi> ſubject to mans paſſions, and every way a right man, <hi>fin onely excepted:</hi> and hence it was, that he was called, <hi>holy, harmleſſe, and ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 19. The Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Paſchall Lamb, which was ſo conditioned; it was behovefull, that Chriſt ſhould be man, and alſo that he ſhould be perfectly holy and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119934:78"/>
righteous, and ſo become a competent and fitting Saviour for ſinning ſoules, and loſt ſinners. It was moſt requiſite, that t here ſhould be ſome ſuitable ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and proportion between him, that loſt all, &amp; him that recover'd all: that as <hi>Adam</hi> was of the earth; ſo Chriſt alſo ſhould take upon him the ſame forme, that ſo ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> nature might ſuffer in him, and he by his death ſhould offer up a ſufficient ſacrifice, to make a full expiation and ſatisfaction for his people, in reſpect of ſin paſt, preſent, and to come; from the guilt and hainouſneſſe whereof, the Saints being wholly acquitted and free'd, their ſoules may be comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt according to his divine nature is God, the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the image of the Father, the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſummity of all bleſſedneſſe and glory. In this reſpect, he is the <hi>Summum benum,</hi> the chiefe and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good, the top of all felicity and happineſſe. Chriſt is that fountaine, from whence all goodneſſe flows, and the ultimate and laſt end, unto which all things tend: <hi>for by him, and for him,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119934:78"/>
of him, and through him, and to him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11. 36. And God tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> that his <hi>Name is in him,</hi> Exod. 23. 20. Gods name is God himſelfe; for God's <hi>name</hi> and attributes are his very eſſence: So that Chriſt according to his divine nature, is full of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection: he is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the ending, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> he is the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centring in one: he is moſt compleat in himſelfe, and hath the fullneſſe of all things. So that as the ſoule lookes upon Chriſt in fleſh, as one moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Mediator: ſo here beholding his divine nature ſees an alſufficiency of fullneſſe to make a glorious ſupply of all wants and defects whatſoever. Chriſt in his debaſements is a familiar object for our faith, being <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or God in our fleſh; ſo in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his fathers image and glory he becomes all bleſſedneſſe and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to our ſoules. The ſoule eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that moſt abſolute, univerſall, and comprehenſive goodneſſe, that is in Chriſt, can be contented to fit downe and acquieſſe in his abſolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fulneſſe: and ſay with <hi>David,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119934:79"/>
I ſhall be ſatisfied, when I awake with his likeneſſe or image,</hi> Pſal. 17. 15.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed how Chriſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the <hi>two</hi> olive trees, in his <hi>two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> The firſt as man, appearing in our form and faſhion, as a familiar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to our weakneſſe. And ſecondly, as God, the fulneſſe and perfection of all things, and ſo yeelding everlaſting ſatisfaction. Now we come in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place to ſhew alſo how Chriſt is repreſented hereby, in reſpect of his twofold diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By what Chriſt hath wrought for us in his perſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By what Chriſt works in us by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we have that diſpenſation of Chriſt's, manifeſted, by what he hath wrought for us in his perſon. Chriſt was God manifeſt in the fleſh, clothed in our nature, became <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and dwelt among us. The Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Gal. 4. 4. That when the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent his Son, made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, under the law.</hi> The time deſigned and appointed of God, is called, the <hi>fulneſſe of time: God ſent his Son,</hi> out of himſelfe, out of his owne eſſence and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119934:79"/>
glory: <hi>made of a woman,</hi> without the concurrence of a man, that the ſeede of the woman might breake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, according to the promiſe made in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Alſo he was <hi>made under the Law:</hi> he obſerved the Law, and made himſelfe wholly ſubject thereunto. He was in all things obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that he might fulfill all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, by ſubmitting to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Chriſt alwayes went about doing of good, as preaching the kingdome of God, and working of miracles: both <hi>miranda</hi> and <hi>miracul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> were wrought by him, to confirme his doctrine that he delivered. Now in all theſe things he gave forth a teſtimony of the wiſedome, power, and goodneſſe of his father, before the world. This was the time of Chriſts propheſie in ſackcloth; being in much ſorrow and ſadneſſe, often tempted by Satan, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes oppoſed by the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees; and having finiſhed his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſuffered the death of the croſſe. And as for the time of Chriſts bearing witneſſe, was by computation (from the time of his inauguration or inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his office, mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119934:80"/>
23. unto the time of his death) the ſame <hi>terme</hi> of time, that here the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſaid to propheſie, namely, <hi>three yeares</hi> and a <hi>halfe.</hi> This is one teſtimony that Chriſt gives forth, by thoſe tranſactions paſſed on him, and by all thoſe works wrought by him, whereby he did worke ſalvation for all his people, in his owne perſon. The whole compendium and perfect draught of our ſalvation, is effectually drawne forth by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth not onely give forth his teſtimony, by what himſelfe doth in his perſon for us, but alſo by that frame, that by his Spirit he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us. Chriſt no ſooner lays downe his fleſhly and viſible appearance to the world, but he appeares in a more ſpirituall and inviſible way unto his Diſciples; ſupplying his corporall abſence, by his ſpirituall preſence. So that as his firſt diſpenſation was by his fleſhly appearance; in like manner his ſecond diſpenſation is his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence; according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that when he ſhould depart, he would <hi>ſend the Comforter,</hi> Joh. 16. 7. The Spirit doth teſtifie of the ſame
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119934:80"/>
things that Chriſt in his perſon did, but in a more inviſible and ſpirituall way; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The ſpirit ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 15. Now that viſible teſtimony that Chriſt gave forth in his fleſh, by his preaching and miracles, &amp;c. was more externall, darke, and in figure, then his ſpirituall appearance and inviſible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations in the ſoules of his people; for by his caſting forth Devills, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of the blinde, and healing the ſicke, and the like: he did by ſuch outward external prefigurations ſhew, what he would doe by his Spirit, by cleanſing, enlightening, and healing of his people; by the inward working of his power, ſpirit, and righteouſneſſe. The ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Chriſt hath wrought outwardly, the ſame he works in ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the reall operation of his Spirit in the hearts of his people. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith; Chriſt is <hi>formed in us, Gal.</hi> 4. 19. The life and death, the workes and image of Chriſt are ſet up and formed in the hearts of beleevers. Thus we ſee, that Chriſt gives forth a teſtimony in ſpirit, as well as in fleſh, and in his ſpirituall preſence, as well
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119934:81"/>
as in his fleſhly appearance.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the ground why Chriſt is called <hi>two</hi> olive trees. Firſt, in reſpect of his two natures, divine and humane: Secondly, in relation to his twofold diſpenſation, the one in fleſh, the other in ſpirit. Now it followeth, that we ſhew, why Saints are called <hi>two Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</hi> The grounds are two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe they conſiſted both of Jewes and Gentiles; whereas mention is made but <hi>of one</hi> Candlefticke in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. becauſe it ſignified the Jewes onely, by whom was repreſented the great Congregation of Saints. But here the Churches of Chriſt being made up of Jew and Gentile, of the Circumciſion and uncircumciſion, they are called <hi>two.</hi> And thus the whole compleat number of Saints and Churches were mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. But I doe not conceive this to be the maine reaſon, therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Saints receive, and conſequently give forth a double teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: the one as it were, fleſhly, low, and earthly; the other more ſpirituall and heavenly. Suitable to the ſtate,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119934:81"/>
condition, frame, and diſpenſation, that Saints are under; accordingly they hold forth a teſtimony of Chriſt. In reſpect of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> weakneſſe, the Apoſtle tells them they were <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> and as babes in Chriſt: and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he ſaith, in reſpect of his divine viſions and revelations, that he was in the third heaven or Paradiſe of God. Now concerning this twofold witneſs or teſtimony, we have it fully expreſſed and ſet forth in 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 7, 8. For there that beare record in hearen, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and theſe three are one: And there are three that beare witneſſe in earth; the Spirit, and the Water, and the Bloud: and theſe three agree in one.</hi> Now by <hi>beaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> we are to underſtand of the ſtate of the Saints, in their ſeverall conditions and ſtations; either carnall and fleſhly, or ſpirituall and heavenly. We ſhall take notice thereof diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the witneſſe or teſtimony in <hi>earth,</hi> preſents us with the coming of Chriſt in fleſh, who came by <hi>water</hi> and <hi>bloud.</hi> The <hi>water</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> that iſſued out of Chriſts ſide, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. did anſwer to the legall waſhings and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119934:82"/>
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the one by <hi>water,</hi> the other by <hi>bloud.</hi> Hereby is ſignified, firſt, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or the ſpirituall waſhing the ſilth and uncleanneſſe of ſinne, as with water: Secondly, <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> whereby the heart of a Saint comes to be freed from the guilt and charge of ſin; and this is, as by bloud. Now as Saints eyeing Chriſt coming by <hi>water</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> they apprehend him to be a ſufficient and comfortable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, juſtifying of their perſons, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of their natures: and ſo are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience in reſpect of Chriſts full expiation <hi>of,</hi> and ſatisfaction <hi>for</hi> ſin. Now the Spirit comes in, and gives its teſtimony unto theſe: for it's ſayd, <hi>theſe agree in one.</hi> The Spirit doth give forth a teſtimony, thorow juſtification and ſanctification, thus repreſented by bloud and water. Now this is called the teſtimony in earth, as being weake and low in compariſon, of that which is far more ſpirituall and heavenly. The Saints under this diſpenſation and ſtate, give forth a ſuitable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; theſe are able to teſtifie of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, of the appeaſing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and of reconciliation; and alſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119934:82"/>
againſt the power of ſin, the accuſation of Satan, and the condemnation of the Law, &amp;c. This here is called the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in earth, as being weak, and low, in reſpect of the other: this is the firſt teſtimony, that the Saints receive, and conſequently that they give forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have a <hi>teſtimony</hi> in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> or a more divine and heavenly witneſſe: and this is the immediate and ſingle witneſſe of the Spirit, that the Apoſtle doth intimate, ſaying, <hi>The ſpirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe with our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit doth ſeale adoption upon our hearts, by witneſſing <hi>to our ſpirits,</hi> or <hi>with</hi> our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, our ſpirits being renewed, and witneſſing to the truth of God: his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth concur and agree with our ſpirits in the ſame teſtimony. Now the <hi>Father, Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that beare this heavenly record, are not ſaid to <hi>agree</hi> in one; but they <hi>are one:</hi> they are <hi>one</hi> in eſſence and nature, but diſtinct in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and diſcovery. The <hi>father</hi> is the originall and fountaine of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore called the <hi>father of lights,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. As being the root of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119934:83"/>
all wiſdome and knowledge, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other good thing. The <hi>Son</hi> is the very forme and appearance of divine excellency; and therefore called the <hi>image of the inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1. 15. for in him we behold the glory of God, as in a glaſſe or image, which in it ſelfe is inviſible and undiſcernable. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is that, which doth make an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation or diſcovery of the Father and Son. <hi>The ſpirit of truth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall teſtifie of me,</hi> Joh. 15. 26. Now theſe <hi>three are one</hi> in eſſence and being, they goe forth together in one; they give a ſingle and pure teſtimony, immediatly, and without any medium coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. To this purpoſe obſerve a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſpoken by Chriſt, when he ſaith; <hi>If any man love me, he will keepe my words; and my father will love him; and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him,</hi> Joh. 14. 23. But how is it, that both the Father and the Son will come to abide and lodge in the cottage of the beleevers heart, that is onely by the ſending forth the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that Chriſt had promiſed as a Comſorter, which was to be the Chariot of the Son and of the Father in one: Here is the Trinity in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119934:83"/>
unity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father and Son, both coming forth in the Spirit, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the hearts of his people. Now this teſtimony of the Father and the Son, and Spirit in <hi>One,</hi> is that divine and heavenly record, that gives a ſure evidence or evident aſſurance unto the heart, of the riches and glory of God, the love and goodneſſe of Chriſt, the light and truth of the Spirit, whereby the ſoule of a beleever is made to ſit downe in heavenly places with Chriſt, and rejoyce in a pleorophery, or full aſſurance of faith, to triumph in the evidence of divine love, to be ſatisfied in the true image of righteouſneſſe and heavenly life, engraven in the heart. Now accordingly, as the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in this teſtimony; ſo they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſame before the world, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes ready to give forth, what ever they receive from the Lord. Such as have received this heavenly witneſſe, are able to give out a far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teſtimony of the truth and glory of God, then thoſe that have received the former earthly teſtimony; even as the Diſciples were more enlarged by the teſtimony of the Spirit, then they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119934:84"/>
wereby their being preſent with Chriſt in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thus we perceive the ground, why the Saints are called <hi>two</hi> Candleſticks. Firſt, becauſe they conſiſted of Jewes and Gentiles. Secondly, becauſe they receive, and conſequently give forth a twofold teſtimony; the firſt earthly; the ſecond heavenly. Now laſtly, we are to enquire, how Chriſt intimated here, by the <hi>two olive trees,</hi> ſhould be joyned with the two Candleſticks, and brought in as a witneſſe in ſackcloth in the ſeverall ages and times of the raigne of Antichriſt? and ſeeing that all this hath been done ſince Chriſt left the earth. Unto which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt and his Saints make but one compleat body, are joyned as head and members, being knit together by one Spirit. This the Apoſtle doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of that one body being many, are one body; ſo is Chriſt; for by one ſpirit, we are baptized into one body.</hi> As it is in the naturall body, ſo it is in the ſpirituall, which conſiſteth of diverſe members, and they of different offices and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119934:84"/>
yet they make but one body. The Church is called the <hi>fulneſſe of his body, that filleth all in all,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 23. as Chriſt is the fulneſſe of all ſpirituall ſupply unto his Saints; ſo his Saints are the fulneſs of his body: both would be defective, and as it were mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d, if they were ſeperated or diſunited one from the other. Now in as much as Chriſt and his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts make but one, and both make up but one body: Hence it is, that the teſtimony of the Saints is attributed to Chriſt, he being joyned with them in propheſie, even in the dayes of Antichriſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>igne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though Chriſt be abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119934:85"/>
which we have heard of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. 5. So that the Saints receive their meſſage and teſtimony from the ſpirit of Chriſt, and accordingly they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſſe. And in this reſpect Chriſt may alſo be ſayd to propheſie in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the teſtimony of Chriſt and his Saints is one and the ſame. The Saints of old gave forth their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their appointed times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they did beare witneſſe to the truth of God, againſt the ſame ſpirit of wickedneſſe, that was acted in their dayes, even as the witneſſes in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth have done under the powerfull raigne of the beaſt. Thus did <hi>Mordicay</hi> and the <hi>Jewes</hi> teſtifie againſt the pride &amp; cruelty of <hi>Hammon.</hi> Thus did Chriſt himſelfe, when he was preſent upon earth, teſtifie againſt the hypocriſie and wickedneſſe of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees. And thus hath the Saints in all the dayes and ages of the man of ſin, given forth a faithful teſtimony for the truth of Chriſt, oppoſing the falſhood and deceit of all the wayes of the man of ſin. Thus we ſee, that the very teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Saints, is the teſtimony of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119934:85"/>
Chriſt, it's Chriſts cauſe and quarrell they are engaged in: well therefore may Chriſt be brought in and joyned with the witneſſes here.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, Chriſt doth not performe this here ſpoken of him, in his perſon, but in his members, 'tis not Chriſt immediatly, and by himſelfe; but mediatly, and by his Saints: It's Chriſt myſtically, that is alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Antichriſt. Suitable unto this is that paſſage in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith; <hi>That he went by the ſpirit, and preached unto thoſe ſpirits now in priſon; having been diſobedient unto the word of God, and deſpiſed his long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dayes of Noah, while the Arke was preparing.</hi> Here that which <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher of righteouſneſſe did, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Noah</hi> was but inſtrumentall in the buſineſſe, it was Chriſt in the ſpirit, that put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe forth in, and through <hi>Noah.</hi> In like manner it was ſayd, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the priſoners did in the priſon, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was the doer of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 22. becauſe they did it by warrant &amp; leave from him, or by his dictation &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Juſt ſo Chriſt is ſayd to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119934:86"/>
propheſie all the dayes of Antichriſt, becauſe his people receive their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and power from him, as mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his cauſe and quarrell.

So ſhall the diſſolution of Antichriſt be by degrees, by little and little, even as the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to encreaſe and double his Spirit upon his people, whereby they are enabled to teſtifie againſt the beaſt &amp; his image: againſt the falſe Prophet and the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and thus by degrees ſhall the man of ſin be deſtroyed. Now we perceive, that it's not onely for the wiſe and learned: neither for the great and mighty ones, to teſtifie of Chriſt, or that they are thoſe by whom Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould be deſtroyed: but its for Saints of all degrees, for every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how poore, how meane ſoever, that have received of that holy oyle from Chriſt, the true <hi>olive tree,</hi> that ſhines forth, with the glorious teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſt; I ſay, every ſuch one is a Prophet, and witneſſe of the Lord. Then all thoſe poor, low, and deſpiſed ones, that have according to their meaſures and attainments, given forth their teſtimony for Chriſt &amp; his truth:

                  </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful carriage of the adverſaries towards the witneſſes: <hi>If any man hurt them.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the means of defence or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made by the witneſſes towards their adverſaries; <hi>fire proceedeth out of their mouths,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the deportment of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and that is expreſſed hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or conditionally; <hi>If any man</hi> &amp;c. whereby a certainty is affirmed. This
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119934:88"/>
indefinite ſpeech doth not imply, that it ſhould be a rare thing for men thus to doe, but rather a certainty of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment ſhould be inflicted upon all thoſe that ſhould any way oppoſe theſe two faithfull witneſſes. <hi>If any man hurt them,</hi> &amp;c. It cannot be meant, as though few ſhould hurt or injure them; but rather that there ſhould be no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons amongſt any that ſhould hurt them; none ſhould goe unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any exterior adjuncts or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatſoever, let them be of any kinde, ranke, or degree, they ſhould ſuffer for their violence offered to them. The certainty of the enemies oppoſing the witneſſes is held forth by the doubling of the phraſe. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> tells <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that by the <hi>doubling of his dream, the thing was eſtabliſhed,</hi> Gen. 41. 32. But how are theſe witneſſes hurt by their enemies?</p>
               <p>Firſt, by reſtraining of their perſons, by perſecution, impriſonment, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the like. It hath been the practice of the beaſt, continually to make war with the Saints, with thoſe that keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:119934:89"/>Secondly, by rejecting their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: the enemy doth not onely go about to hinder the courſe of their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but alſo to turne the <hi>truth</hi> they hold forth into a <hi>lye:</hi> Hence it is ſaid, that the beaſt opened his <hi>mouth in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, againſt God, his name, Tabernacle, and people,</hi> Revel. 13. 6. Now to <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,</hi> is to ſpeak evill, to revile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the teſtimony of the Saints; to bring ſome blot upon the truth they ſtand to maintaine. Thus we ſee how certaine it is, that the enemies will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and hinder the witneſſes in the courſe of their propheſie. And as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that the enemies ſhall ſuffer for this their attempt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the meanes by which the witneſſes do oppoſe their adverſaries: <hi>fire proceedeth out of their mouths to devour their enemies.</hi> As before we had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the witneſſes, by the <hi>two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed ones,</hi> relating to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua:</hi> ſo here we have their actions declared, by an alluſion unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> both which were revenged for wrong done upon their enemies by <hi>fire</hi> from heaven. Thus you may read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 35. That when <hi>Korah,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119934:89"/>
the reſt of his company did riſe up in rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes, fire comes from heaven,</hi> &amp; deſtroys thoſe two hundred and fifty chiefe men of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Alſo of <hi>Elias,</hi> you have it related 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 10, 11. That when <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſent two captains, with their fifties, to apprehend the Prophet; <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire cometh downe from the Lord, and deſtroys both the Captaines and their fifties.</hi> So here the witneſſes are ſaid to command fire to conſume their enemies.</p>
               <p>This cannot be meant of a materiall, but of a myſticall fire, that the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do thus breath out of their mouths. It is the word of their teſtimony that doth conſume and deſtroy their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; it is this fire that doth conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torment and devour them. Thus we have the word often called <hi>fire</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Jere. 23. 29. Is not my word like fire, ſaith the Lord?</hi> And we have the Lord telling the Prophet, that he would <hi>make his word as fire, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wood, and it ſhould devour them,</hi> Jer. 5. 14.

               <p>The Adverſary ſhall in <hi>this manner be killed</hi> by the <hi>Fire</hi> that iſſueth out of the mouths of the Witneſſes.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119934:93"/>
that it raine not.</hi> In which phraſe wee have an alluſion to <hi>Elias,</hi> of whom we have the Apoſtle teſtifying, that <hi>hee prayed, and it rained not for the ſpace of three yeares, and ſixe moneths,</hi> Jam. 5. 17. which holds a juſt proportion of <hi>time</hi> with theſe Witneſſes Propheſie in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath: So that as <hi>Elias</hi> prevailed with God, that it rained not for three years and a halfe, ſo here theſe Witneſſes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame power from God, that it ſhould not rain all the days of their Propheſie. Now further conſider two things. 1. What is meant by raine.</p>
               <p>2. What it is to ſhut Heaven.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are not to underſtand this of a naturall raine, but of that which is myſticall and ſpirituall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is denoted the heavenly influences of God, the ſweet refreſhing heavenly dewes that deſcend from him.

                  </gap>t, through the Goſpel of Chriſt are here meant by this ſpirituall raine. Suitable unto this is that phraſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>My doctrine ſhall drop as the rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, and my ſpeech a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the dew,</hi> Deutr. 32. 2.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119934:94"/>
As if he had ſaid: My Doctrine ſhall drop upon your hearts, to mollifie them, to refreſh them, to make them fruitfull; even as the raine and dew of heaven doth fall upon the earth, to ſoften it, to refreſh it, and to make it fruitfull, to make graſſe and flowers to ſprowt and ſpring out of it. Then the Goſpel and word of Chriſt, with all the heavenly dews of divine graces, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling and falling from God, are here ſignified by <hi>raine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To ſhut heaven that it raine not,</hi> is to exclude all the ways and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, all the invented worſhips and ſervices of Antichriſt, from thoſe ſweet diſtillings and divine droppings of that heavenly rain and dew that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Lord. The Witneſſes by their Propheſie againſt all ſuperſtitious formes, upon all invented ordinances and practices of Antichriſt, do hinder the heavenly dew of divine grace from falling upon it, as it were ſhutting up heaven againſt them, by excluding of them from the wayes and Ordinances of Chriſt, or ſuch as the Lord doth make uſe of, to convey thoſe gracious influences of ſpirit and life unto his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119934:94"/>
people. The Witneſſes exclude all the worſhips and forms of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> from having any of the light, life, or power of Chriſt in them, they caſt them out, and reject them; they propheſie againſt them, as falſe and empty things, as things of no value or worth, and ſo conſequently <hi>ſhut heaven</hi> againſt them, that is, raine not the ſhowers of divine grace and life, all the dayes of their Propheſie.</p>
               <p>Thus the great <hi>power</hi> of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is ſet forth by a reſemblance to that of <hi>Elias,</hi> who prevailed with God, that it rained not for the ſpace of three years, and ſixe moneths: So theſe by their Propheſie againſt the wayes and practice, the worſhips and ſervices of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> doe hinder the ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Heaven, and the refreſhing ſhowers of divine grace and comfort from flowing down upon them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become as light and empty, as having no vertue or life at all in them; they have no more Rain from heaven; they wither as plants that God hath not planted, as branches that have no life or ſap in them.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, theſe have <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119934:95"/>
to turne waters into blood.</hi> Here wee have another reſemblance, and that is unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who turned the Aegyptian waters into blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 20. the ſame thing you have done by the hands of the Witneſſes. This is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the effects of the ſecond and third vials, where you have mention made of <hi>turning waters into blood alſo, Rev.</hi> 16. 3, 4. So that the propheſie of the Witneſſes hath the ſame effect, with the powring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orth of the Vials, even to <hi>turne waters into blood.</hi> Now as wee did underſtand their <hi>deſtroying their enemies with fire;</hi> and their <hi>ſhutting heaven, that it raine not.</hi> Myſtically and ſpiritually before, ſo here muſt we underſtand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of their turning waters into blood. Therefore conſider, 1. What is meant by <hi>waters.</hi> 2. What it is to <hi>turne them into blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, by <hi>waters,</hi> we may underſtand all the ſweet refreſhing ſtreams of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſtrength, ſupply and life that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt did live upon, as all worſhip and Religion, all order and govrn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all peace and uniformity, all doctrine and practice: all theſe are as ſo many ſtreams of water, by which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119934:95"/>
Antichriſt is comforted and refreſhed, they being his very ſupport and life. The waters that the Egyptians were to <hi>drinke,</hi> to live upon, and be refreſhed by, were turned into blood, ſo that they were like to dye with thirſt, both they and their Cattell: So this water is the very life, ſweetneſſe, and peace that the world doth enjoy, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To <hi>turn</hi> theſe <hi>waters</hi> into <hi>blood,</hi> is no other, then to imbitter all that ſweet peace and reſt the world would enjoy all thoſe pleaſant ſtreams of union, peace, and delight, are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into contention and bitterneſſe, ſo that the world cannot drinke them downe at pleaſure, they are diſturbed and troubled; their ſweet ſtreames are turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d into blood and contention; their quiet waters are diſturbed by the propheſie of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what is meant by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and how they are turned into blood. It followeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, <hi>They ſmite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is one word to comprehend all evills that ſhould befall Antichriſt, by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119934:96"/>
the propheſie of the Witneſſes: There needeth no more particulars be named to expreſſe thoſe calamities that ſhould befal the world. This doth relate to the powring forth of the vials, mentioned in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. where it is ſaid, that the ſeven Angels <hi>ſhould powre out the vials of of the wrath of God upon the earth,</hi> verſ. 1. So here, theſe ſhall <hi>ſmite the earth with all plagues;</hi> that is, theſe by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and teſtimony of the truth, ſhal pour out the vials of Gods wrath and indignation upon Antichriſt and his adherents. Here then take notice of the plagues that light upon the world, by the powring forth of the Vials, and of them conſider;</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is a full agreement between the ſeven Seals, ſeven Trump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and ſeven Vials, each one dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond and anſwr to the other. The opening of the firſt Seale, the ſounding of the firſt Trumpet, the pouring forth of the firſt Viall, are at one and the ſame time; and ſo of them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have neer affinity and relation each unto the other: the opening of the Seals, do occaſion the ſounding of the Trumpets; and the ſounding of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119934:96"/>
Trumpets doe cauſe the Vialls to be poured forth. The opening of the Seals by degrees, and in a graduall way, are thoſe ſeveral degrees of light &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the Lord doth diſcover to his Saints in their ſeverall ages, of the ſecret and hidden myſteries of truth, which contains in it ſelfe a perfection of myſterie, as being ſealed up with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeals: now gradually in every age the Lord comes forth, in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and revelations of theſe myſteries unto his Saints. The ſounding of the Trumpets follow hereupon, which is the outward declaration and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of truth by the witneſſes; whereby they give forth a viſible teſtimony of the truths of GOD thus revealed to them, by preaching, praying, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, they do as it were, ſound forth the Trumpet of divine truth. The pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of the Vials, are thoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and evils that fall upon the man of ſin, by reaſon of the trumpets ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But know, that every Seal, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trumpet, and every Viall wil agree together in their opening, ſounding, and pouring forth: every Seal hath its Trumpet, and every Trumpet hath its
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119934:97"/>
Vial that doth follow. So that we may not conceive that the opening of the Seals preſents us with one age, the ſounding of the Trumpet with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the pouring forth of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als with a third; but that the firſt Seal, firſt Trumpet, and firſt Viall are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſounded, and poured forth in one age, and the ſecond Seal, ſecond Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and ſecond Vial in another, and ſo they agree and goe together untill they are finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly conſider, that the plagues that are the effects that follow upon theſe Seals opened, Trumpets ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Vials poured forth, are not only, or ſo much meant of outward or temporall plagues, but rather of myſticall, of ſuch ſpiritual judgements that ſhould be poured out upon the head of the man of ſin, to deſtroy him, not only in body: but in ſpirit and worſhip, whereby the very intereſt and cauſe of Antichriſt ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. And now I ſay, that theſe plagues, and evill effects that follow the firſt ſeal, are the ſame that doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the firſt Trumpet, and firſt Viall, ſo of the ſecond, and in like manner
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119934:97"/>
to the end. Wee ſhall only ſpeak of thoſe plagues that follow the powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Vials; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, wee include thoſe alſo that follow the Seales and the Trumpets.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Viall was poured upon the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Viall.</hi>

                  <hi>earth;</hi> that is, upon the Antichriſtian Church and State, which conſiſteth of of earthly worſhip, and is made up of worldly Chriſtians: and the effects of this Vial poured out, was, that there <hi>fell a grievous ſore upon the men that had the marke of the Beaſt upon them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped his Image.</hi> This ſoare is like to be incurable, agreeing with that which followed the ſound of the firſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 7. And there <hi>followed hail mingled with hlood, and they were caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and the third part of the trees were burnt up, and all greene graſſe was burnt up.</hi> This <hi>haile</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> agrees with the Thunder, which hapned at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the firſt Seale, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. All which ſhewes, that by this Thunder, this Fire and Haile, together with this great ſore, that the life and peace, the worſhip and forme of the third part of thoſe that ſerved the Beaſt, were burnt up, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

were like green trees in ſhew of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and zeale, became as dry and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, without bloſſome, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fruit at all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Viall was poured out upon</hi>

This is the ſame with the effect of the Witneſſes propheſie, when they <hi>turn waters into blood.</hi> Sutably at the opening of the ſecond Seal, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. 3, 4. there appeared a <hi>red horſe,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>blood,</hi> preparing for War and death. The ſame effect follows the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Trumper, <hi>Chap. 8, 9. A great mountaine buring with fire was caſt into the ſea, and the third part of the ſea became blood, &amp;c.</hi> This effect preſents us with the death of all the ſweet comforts, ſweet enjoyments, that the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church did feed on; all thoſe formes of worſhip and ſervice they took much delight in, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by, now they are turned into blood, yea like the blood of a dead man, which was moſt deadly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in its own nature, that none may drink of it, but the ſhall dye: every ſoule that was at reſt and peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

and thought it ſelfe moſt ſafe and in a good condition, now it languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, gives up the ghoſt, and dieth.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Viall was poured upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>

               <p>Firſt, of the <hi>time when</hi> theſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould be ſlaine, and that's declared to be, <hi>when they have finiſhed their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> Theſe witneſſes have a time to propheſie, and alſo a time when they ſhall finiſh their teſtimony, and then they are ſlaine. The maine thing we are to quire after, is to know when theſe have <hi>finiſhed</hi> their teſtimony; and then we ſhall eaſily know, when they are to be ſlaine. Now the moſt received opinion is, that theſe witneſſes never come to finiſh their teſtimony, untill neer the end and period of Antichriſts raigne, that there ſhould be ſome great and eminent ſlaughter at the latter end of their propheſie, upon the declining of Antichriſt's ſtate and kingdome; but this is far remote from the true ſcope and ſence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he truth in this place; for ſo the ſlaying of the witneſſes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119934:108"/>
ſhould be reſtrained to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and to ſome particular time, and that neer the end of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts raigne: whereas the ſlaving of the witneſſes, is a continued act, even all the dayes of the powerfull raigne of the beaſt, who doth alwayes make war againſt theſe, and doth alwayes overcome and kill the holy people, (all the time, that the holy Citie is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into his hand) to trample upon them and abuſe them.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>time</hi> when theſe witneſſes have finiſhed their teſtimony is meant no more then this, that when any of the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt, ſhall in any age or time of Antichriſt, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and fully diſcharge their truſt, deliver their meſſage, give forth their teſtimony of thoſe truths of Chriſt, that they are convinced of, againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and the preſent evills of the times they live under: then they are ſayd to finiſh their teſtimony. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is variouſly tranſlated, the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute render it, <hi>when</hi> they are about to finiſh their teſtimony. This they doe, before they are ſlaine; and becauſe they doe this, therefore they are ſlaine; for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119934:109"/>
they are ſlaine becauſe of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they give forth. Thus Chriſt was ſayd to <hi>finiſh hu worke,</hi> Joh. 17. 4. by that faithfull teſtimony he gave of the Father. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, he had <hi>finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his courſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7. when he had faithfully diſcharged his truſt, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel, according to his Commiſſion. So the Saints in every age and time, when they have faithfully gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their evidence and teſtimony of that truth they know, then they have finiſhed their teſtimony: and not that all the witneſſes ſhould firſt give in their teſtimony, and at the laſt a few of them ſhould be ſlaine; but that, I ſay, every Saint, every witneſſe of the Lord, in every age and time ſhall faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully give in his teſtimony, and then is ſlaine: ſo that the ſlaying of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes is not confined to one time, or the laſt period of Antichriſt; but their ſlaying continues as long, as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in ſackcloth, as we ſhall ſhew more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by <hi>whom</hi> ſhall theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be ſlaine; and that is, by the <hi>beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit.</hi> Now for the opening of this paſſage, conſider three things.</p>

                  <item>Firſt, who is meant by this <hi>beaſt</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, from <hi>whence</hi> he cometh.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, the <hi>forme</hi> or manner of his coming.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, by this <hi>beaſt</hi> is meant <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is ſo called from his beaſtly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being moſt fierce and cruell, moſt barbarous and dangerous. So he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>beaſt</hi> in Chap. 13. 4, 5. becauſe his mouth is full of blaſphemy, and his carriage full of inhumanity: for his rage, fury, and madneſſe he is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beaſt; being of a devouring nature, and of a beaſtly diſpoſition. The who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh woman is ſayd to ride upon the <hi>beaſt,</hi> Chap. 17. 7. The woman is that whoriſh and Antichriſtian ſpirit, that doth ride forth, and act by a beaſtly, inhumane power, and as a beaſt doth devour and deſtroy; and the <hi>Kings of the earth give their power unto the beaſt,</hi> and ſo they become beaſtly, fierce and untractable alſo The beaſt then is no other, then that wicked one, that ſon of perdition, that ſpirit of wickedneſſe, that myſtery of iniquity, putting it ſelfe forth in ſome corrupt and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power and carriage, moſt fierce and devouring; it is Antichriſt in his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119934:110"/>
power and greatneſſe, oppreſſing and deſtroying the Saints of the moſt high. So much for the deſcription of the beaſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from <hi>whence</hi> this beaſt doth <hi>ariſe,</hi> and that is from the <hi>bottomleſſe pit,</hi> or deep <hi>Abyſſe.</hi> The <hi>beaſt</hi> mentioned in Chapt. 13. 1. is ſayd to ariſe out of the <hi>ſea,</hi> that is, out of many peoples and nations. And the beaſt in verſ. 13. is ſayd to ariſe out of the <hi>earth;</hi> from a kingly or earthly power. But this beaſt that ſlayeth the witneſſes ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of the <hi>bottomleſſe pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things are ſayd to aſcend out of the bottomeeſſe pit. Firſt, the <hi>ſmoke of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> Chap. 9. 2. which is meant of all Antichriſtian darkneſſe and confuſion. Secondly, we read of the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 11. which is Satan, called therefore <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> whoſe worke is to deſtroy others. Laſtly, we have the <hi>beaſt</hi> that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit; ſpoken of here; and alſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 8.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>ſmoke</hi> of the bottomleſſe pit, is meant of that darkneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, of that ignorance &amp; blindneſſe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119934:110"/>
that doth ariſe upon the ſoule as a thicke cloud, from the fleſhly acting of the heart; whereby the minde and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is wholly darkned and obſcured; according to that of the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Gentiles, ſaith, <hi>Having their underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their heart,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. Blindneſſe and darkneſſe is upon all the thoughts and inventions, upon all the carnall actings of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Angel of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit, is Satan, that Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that evill ſpirit, that rules in the children of diſobedience, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. The Prince and power of darkneſſe, by his inſtigations and ſuggeſtions doth rule and ſway mans heart. By the cloſe of mans heart with Satan, he is capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated &amp; enſnared, and ſo brought into ſubjection unto him, as unto a mighty Prince or Ruler. Thus we ſee who is ment by the <hi>Angel</hi> of the bottomles pit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>beaſt</hi> of the <hi>bottomleſſe pit,</hi> is Antichriſt in the forme of a beaſt, or acting in his beaſtly, inhumane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, with much cruelty and fierceneſſe.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119934:111"/>
Now what is this bottomleſſe pit, or deep Abyſſe, that hath no bottome, it cannot be meaſured, none can take a dimention of it; now I ſay, what is this, but that helliſh working, thoſe fleſhly imaginations, thoſe blacke and beaſtly devices of mans heart; whereof there is no meaſure or end, none can fadome them, none can ſearch the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of them. Wee told you before, that the frame and image of Antichriſt, did ariſe from the ſpirit of Antichriſt; ſo here this beaſt, or power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that ſlayeth the witneſſes, ariſeth out of that helliſh wickedneſſe, that rage and cruelty, from that darkneſſe and confuſion in the heart of man; this is the pit that hath no bottome; this beaſt or forme of wickednes, this beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power, that ſlayeth the witneſſes, hath no foundation, it is not brought forth by any inſtitution of Chriſt, it hath no ſuch bottom to faſten it ſelfe on, but doth ariſe from the evill ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of mans heart: this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; rage hath no limits or bounds: the heart of man cloſing with Satan, doth hatch &amp; bring forth all the moſt abominable &amp; hideous, the moſt black
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119934:111"/>
and monſtrous wickedneſſe, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the world: This wickedneſſe ariſing into power and greatneſſe, breaketh forth into cruelty and rage, into madneſſe and beaſtlineſſe: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt acting upon this principall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as a beaſt, and is fierce and cruell; he being in power doth kill and ſlay the witneſſes and faithfull ſervants of Chriſt. And this beaſt ariſeth out of the bottomleſſe pit, that is without breadth or length, ſuch as cannot be fathomed or meaſured, being full of darkneſſe and blackneſſe of torment and confuſion. Thus we ſee what is meant by the bottomleſſe pit; from whence this beaſt cometh, that maketh war with the Saints. Hence it is; that the Apoſtle ſayth; The coming of the man of ſin, <hi>is after the working of Satan, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. It is Satan that doth cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the mindes and underſtandings of men, and powerfully ſeduce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: So that Satans working upon the hearts of men, doth produce all thoſe ſtrange inventions &amp; deceits, all that darkneſſe and confuſion, all thoſe horrid deſignes and plots: that cauſeth all that rage and cruelty, that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119934:112"/>
mans heart doth hatch &amp; bring forth, even all that killing and ſlaying enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that Antichriſt doth exerciſe againſt the witneſſes. So much for the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bottomles pit, from whence the beaſt cometh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the manner of this beaſts coming; he doth <hi>aſcend up,</hi> &amp;c. that is into greatneſſe and power, he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe up high in dignity and dominion. This beaſt doth aſcend from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit of the workings of Satan, from that darkneſſe, blackneſſe, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rage, cruelty in mans heart, up unto greatneſſe, power, and dominion. This wickedneſſe doth not lye in the helliſh imaginations of mans heart, cloſed up in thoſe unfathomed and endleſſe thoughts and inventions; but it aſcendeth up into power and action, it ariſeth into height and dominion, and then breaketh forth into cruelty and oppreſſion. Thus the beaſt is ſayd to <hi>aſcend out of the ſea,</hi> Chap. 13. 1. that is, he as being greedy of ſupremacy and greatneſſe, did aſcend by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, untill he was lifted up into the higheſt power and dominion. So this beaſt doth <hi>aſcend</hi> out of the bottomleſs
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119934:112"/>
pit, to a ſtate of ſtrength and power: As it is ſayd in Chap. 13. 2. <hi>The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave unto the beaſt his power, and his ſeat, and great authority,</hi> that ſo he might make war with the Saints and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and kill them. Thus much for the manner of the beaſts aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be conſidered, is the manner how the witneſſes are to be ſlaine; and that is expreſſed by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold action of the beaſt, that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit; he ſhall,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>make warre</hi> againſt them.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, ſhall <hi>overcome</hi> them.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, he ſhall <hi>kill</hi> them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, we have the war, that this beaſt makes againſt the witneſſes. This is the <hi>war in heaven,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 7. between <hi>Michael</hi> and his <hi>Angels,</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his <hi>Angels;</hi> That is, Chriſt and his people waging a ſpirituall war, againſt the Devill and his agents. This repreſents us with the ſpirit of enmity and malice of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, put forth in the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Dragon: here is the ſeede of the Serpent, and the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, conflicting and fighting one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other. When the woman is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119934:113"/>
fled into the wilderneſs, and Antichriſt himſelfe having taken the poſſeſſion of the outward Court, yet the Dragon makes war with the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>Chap. 12. ult.</hi> This war is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being a ſpirituall Combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Antichriſt. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, the malice, and the inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the ſeed of the Serpent is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes putting it ſelfe forth againſt Chriſt, his ſervants, his image, and truth. Hence it was, that Chriſt told the <hi>Jewes, That they were of their father the Devill, who was a murtherer from the beginning,</hi> Joh. 8. 44. They received the root and ſeed of malice and hatred from Satan, the accuſer of the ſervants of Chriſt, who doth alwayes raiſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, war, and contention againſt them. Thus the beaſt being filled with the curſed ſeed of the envie and malice of the Serpent, doth alwayes make war with the Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this beaſt ſhall <hi>overcome</hi> the witneſſes. This repreſents us with the craft and ſubtilty of the Serpent, whereby he ſhall enſnare and intrap the Saints for the time that they ſhall be given into his hand. Thus it is ſaid
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119934:113"/>
of the King of a fierce countenance, that <hi>through his policy he ſhould cauſe craft to proſper in his hand,</hi> Dan. 8. 25. And ſo in <hi>Dan. 11. 31. He ſhall corrupt with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</hi> Such is the craft and ſubtilty of Antichriſt, who by faire pretenies, and ſubtill devices doth betray the Saint. And thus he doth, by tranſlating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into an Angel of light, taking up the forme of Chriſt, to perſecute the ſpirit and life of Chriſt. The beaſt comes forth with faire pretences, like a woman in ſome glorious dreſſe, <hi>aray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in purple, and ſcarlet colour, decked with gold and precious ſtones, and pearles,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 17. 4. having many excellencies of nature, and formes of worſhip, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane gifts, and a counterfeit ſpirit; that ſo the whole world wander after the beaſt, ſaying, <hi>Who is like unto the beaſt?</hi> But when he hath by ſubtilty and deceit brought about his owne ends, then he <hi>openeth his mouth in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God,</hi> to blaſpheme his name, and abuſe his people, by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Cannons, Lawes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; ſo that, to the <hi>malice,</hi> here is added the <hi>ſubtilty</hi> of the beaſt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and enſnare the Saints, and to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119934:114"/>
bring them under his power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, all the appoynted time, while they are given into his hand. Thus the beaſt by turning Religion into a Law, and by eſtabliſhing his formes of worſhip by civill ſanction, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, taking into his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the powers of the world, he doth prevaile againſt, and overcome the witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the beaſt is ſayd to <hi>kill</hi> theſe witneſſes. And this repreſents us with the ſpirit of cruelty; herein he doth beaſt-like, devour and deſtroy the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt. Now we muſt not underſtand this <hi>killing</hi> of the witneſſes, of a literall or outward ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of a <hi>Myſticall</hi> ſlaying; for they are not here ſlaine as <hi>men;</hi> but they are ſlaine as <hi>witneſſes:</hi> and ſo their killing here imports two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a reſtraint layd upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſometimes by impriſonment and baniſhment, ſometimes by throwing them from place and office, from rule and government, by ſilencing and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of them; ſome way or other hindering them in the courſe of their propheſie. Thus the <hi>Jewes</hi> caſt out the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119934:114"/>
poore man out of the Synagogue, that Chriſt made to ſee, <hi>Job.</hi> 9. And all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gave a teſtimony of the power of Chriſt, who opened his eyes. Thus the high Prieſts &amp; Phariſees did beate, miſuſe, and impriſon the Apoſtles, in <hi>Act.</hi> Chap. 4. and Chap. 5. Thus the beaſt doth put in execution all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Laws, and Eccleſiaſticall Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, to hinder, reſtraine, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſturb the witneſſes in the courſe of their propheſie. Thus firſt, they are civilly ſlaine, by reſtraint upon their perſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are ſpiritually ſlaine, by the caſting forth and rejecting of their teſtimony. It is the practice and endeavour of the beaſt to turne the truth of their teſtimony into a lie, and into falſhood, by reproaching, contemning, and ſcandalizing the word of their teſtimony, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull names of error and ſciſme. There hath been all the dayes of the raigne of Antichriſt, ſome truth that the Saints have teſtified of, that hath been under much ſhame and reproach, that hath been moſt rejected by the world. Hence it is, that the Lord ſaith
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119934:115"/>
unto the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that ſhe had <hi>kept the word of his patience,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 3. 10. Now what is the word of Gods patience; but that word and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, that the world doth reject, caſt forth as dung, and trample upon. That truth which is moſt under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorne of the world; which the Saints ſuffer moſt by, &amp; for which they are made the off-ſcouring of all things: That word of truth that is moſt oppoſed in each age of the world, is the word of Chriſts patience. Thus wee ſee how the witneſſes are ſlaine, firſt, civilly, by a reſtraint layd upon their perſons. Secondly, ſpiritually, by the world, caſting forth, and rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their teſtimony. This of their teſtimony is that, which moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, and moſt conſtantly theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſlaine in; for all the enmity of the fleſh, and the power of the world hath alwayes been oppoſing the truth they aſſert, not at all owning, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes condemning, ſlighting, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the teſtimony that theſe give forth of Chriſt, or of his Spirit. As the <hi>Jewes</hi> firſt killed the perſon of Chriſt, and afterwards ſought againſt his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119934:115"/>
and truth: ſo Antichriſt doth not onely by Eccleſiaſtiall Cannons and humane Inſtitutions, reſtraine the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the witneſſes, exerciſing a civill death over their perſons; but alſo they ſuppreſſe and ſlay the very truths and teſtimonies that they beare witneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Thus we ſee how the beaſt doth kill theſe witneſſes; and what manner of ſlaying they ſuffer.</p>
               <p>The Text being thus far opened; we are now to come to give you ſome obſervations from it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Obſerve, <hi>That the Saints of Chriſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>in every age and time, are enabled to finiſh their teſtimony, maugre all the oppoſition that is made againſt them.</hi> Antichriſt by all his fury and rage cannot ſo farre hinder theſe witneſſes, as that they ſhould not finiſh their teſtimony. The Lord doth give opportunity to every one of his faithfull ſervants, that they may finiſh their worke, deliver their meſſage, and faithfully declare that committed to their truſt, before they are taken off, or wholly reſtrained by the power of the beaſt. This was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in Chriſt, when the <hi>Jewes</hi> had a minde to apprehend him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119934:116"/>
but could not lay hands on him, becauſe his <hi>houre was not come,</hi> Joh. 8. 20. It was not in their power to put Chriſt to death, untill he had finiſhed his teſtimony: and therefore he ſaith, <hi>When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye ſtretehed forth no hands againſt me: but this is your houre, and the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Luk. 22. 53. As if Chriſt had ſayd, When I was daily with you in the Temple, preaching the kingdome of God, and performing the worke, that the Father gave me to doe, ye did not, ye could not lay hands on me, to take me: but this is <hi>your houre,</hi> or time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath permitted you to rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and the Priace of darkneſſe hath power, that by your hands I ſhould be taken, and put to death. In the ſame manner the Lord doth firſt impower his faithfull witneſſes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their meſſage, to finiſh their teſti-mony, by aſſerting the truth of Chriſt, oppoſing the wickedneſſe and falſhood of Antichriſt, before they are ſlaine or taken off by the adverſary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that Antichriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">2 Obſerv:</note> a <hi>beaſt,</hi> Obſerve, <hi>That the rage and cruelty of the adverſary is very great againſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119934:116"/>
the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt.</hi> Antichriſt is of a cruell, fierce, corrupt, beaſtly, and inhumane nature; and therefore compared to all the moſt ravenous and devouring beaſts, as to a Serpent for ſubtilty, to a Lyon for ſtrength and rage, to a Beare for devouring, to a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard for his fierceneſſe, and the like. We have the Apoſtle teſtifying of this, when he ſaith of himſelfe; <hi>I fought with beaſts at Epheſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32.

               <p>Now that the externall part of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the formes and figures of it, when 'tis ſpirit-leſſe, and without life, is as a dead body or carkaſe.

But if we would enquire for the minde of Chriſt in this Text, wee are to conſider the whole drift and ſcope of the Chapter, which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a full and ample declaration, or rather a prediction of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Church of the Jewes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainly by the beginning of the Chapter. Now in the middeſt of thoſe tribulations &amp; deſolations that ſhould befall the State, &amp; Church of the Jewes; <hi>Many ſhould ſay, lo here, or lo there is Chriſt, verſ.</hi> 23. But Chriſt exhorts them not to beleeve thoſe falſe Prophets, that ſhould ſay, he was in the <hi>deſert,</hi> or in the <hi>ſecret Chamber:</hi> and why? <hi>For as the lightening cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth even unto the Weſt, ſo ſhall alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of man be.</hi> Now as it is the native property of lightning to make a full diſcovery of it ſelfe, by it's light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe and brightneſſe: ſo Chriſt ſhall be eminently manifeſted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Meſſiah, by the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the Temple and worſhip of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> So that Chriſt's coming to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was like

lightning; for what could more evince and teſtifie, that Chriſt was the true Meſſiah, then the deſtruction of the Temple &amp; worſhip of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which they upheld after the coming of Chriſt; when it ſhould all have been aboliſhed. Chriſt foretelling of this deſtruction, by which himſelfe ſhould be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, coming as lightning, ſhining from the Eaſt to the Weſt: ſaith; <hi>For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the carkaſe is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> Now by the <hi>carkaſe</hi> he meaneth <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and the worſhip of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which they kept up in uſe, after the coming of Chriſt, when the Jewiſh formes were to be aboliſhed, when the ſpirit, life, &amp; preſence of God was departed from theſe things; then the State, &amp; Church, their Temple and worſhip became as a dead carkaſe, without any life or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in it; they onely upheld the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall part of their forme and ſervice, when there was no breath of life, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Spirit of God left in it.

Thus it was with the Temple and worſhip, with the people and Cities of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> being left of God, without his preſence and ſpirit, became as a dead carkaſe, and the enemies, like birds of prey, came and devour's them. So here, when the<note place="margin">

For what is all the forme of worſhip, and ſervice of the carnall Church, and of worldly Chriſtians, but as a dead carkaſe, life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and ſpirit-leſſe. The <hi>Jewes</hi> kept up all their formes of worſhip after the Meſſiah was come, and had aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them all; and therefore it was, that when the Apoſtle was asked, why he would revile <hi>Gods high Prieſt?</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, he did not know him to be Gods high Prieſt; for, ſaith he, it is

It cannot properly be taken for one ſtreet; for thero is no great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie made of one ſtreet: but indeed the word, as rendred by the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint, ſignifies a whole Countrey, the whole confines or bounds of a place: So that this <hi>ſtreet</hi> cannot be meant of one ſtreet, or diſtinct place, but of the whole territory and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Dominion, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and extent of all the Nations, and Churches, that are under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and command of Antichriſt: the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt limits and extreme bounds of largeneſſe and greatneſſe is here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the <hi>ſtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, we come to a deſcription of this Citie, and that is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, by reſemblance; firſt, to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> ſecondly, to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by ſome carriage or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Citie towards Chriſt: it's the place where <hi>our Lord was crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Citie</hi> is deſcribed by a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> in a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall way; for here we have the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> which means ſomething that's ſpirituall and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119934:124"/>
myſticall: not that it's ſpirituall, as oppoſed to carnall or earthly, but as oppoſed to <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> literally and properly ſo called. Then it's meant of <hi>Metaphoricall Sodome,</hi> and of <hi>Myſticall Aegypt,</hi> by way of an alluſion or reſemblance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Sodome</hi> was a place full of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and uncleanneſs, as we have the relation in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. And the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sodome</hi> was ſayd to be <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>fulneſſe of bread,</hi> and abundance of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and laſciviouſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49, 50. It was with this abominable wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was ſo much vexed and perplexed in ſpirit, at the ſight and beholding thereof. Suitable unto this, is the ſpirituall uncleanneſs and filthineſs gf Antichriſt, called the mother of Harlots, full of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, corrupting the earth by her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and intoxicating the whole world with the wine of her fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In a word, all the whoredome, fornication, and abomination of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> are ſpiritually hatched and acted by this whoriſh woman, this great City <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, this Antichriſtian Church, this abominable Strumpet,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119934:125"/>
the great Harlot of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have a reſemblance to <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Firſt, in reſpect of Idolatry and and Superſtition, as appears, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 12. They were full of Idols and falſe gods, they did worſhip their Kine, and other Cattell; for it was the cuſtome of the Heathen to worſhip their Kine, and other Cattell; for it was the cuſtome of the Heathen to worſhip that for Gods, that the Iſraelites were to offer in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto God: Hence it was, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would not, that the children ſhould offer Sacriſice untill they were come forth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> leſt they ſhould follow the example of the Aegyptians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Aegypt</hi> was full of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and oppreſſion towards the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> their Task-maſters laid on heavy burthens on their ſhoulders, and that with much vigour and cruelty, as 'tis related in <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 13. The taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the oppreſſion of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> made it to be the very houſe of bondage. The ſame things are found in myſticall <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as Idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: all the whole bundle of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts worſhip, is but of carnall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and humane inſtitution, yea it is ſpirituall whoredome and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So alſo may we finde in her all the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119934:125"/>
cruelty and oppreſſion of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> here are thoſe Task-maſters, that by their civill power, and Eccleſiaſticall Laws doe continually vex, and torment the Saints. As once <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſtroyed the male children of the Iſraelites, ſo the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſtanding before the woman, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devoure her children: and when the woman flyeth into the wilderneſſe for ſhelter and relief, he caſts a flood of perſecution after her, and continually maketh warre with the <hi>remnant of her ſeede, which keepe the commandement of God, &amp; have the teſtimonie of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 12. 4. 16, 17.

               <p>The ſecond deſcription of the Citie by its <hi>carriage</hi> and <hi>action;</hi> it's where <hi>our Lord was crucified.</hi> This cannot be meant literally, or according to the letter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for ſo Chriſt was cruciſied at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but it is meant ſpiritually and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that Chriſt is crucified in his truth and members, in <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Aegypt:</hi> it's the pride and filthineſſe of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and the curſed idolatry and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119934:126"/>
of <hi>Aegypt</hi> that doth alwayes cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Chriſt in his lawes and ſervants, but conſider;</p>
               <p>Firſt, though Chriſt in his perſon was put to death at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet hee was crucified by a <hi>Roman</hi> power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Pilate,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Judge, and was adjudged by a <hi>Roman</hi> kinde of<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 31.

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is crucified myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and that is in his truth and laws, in his members and people. <hi>Acts 9. 5. Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee?</hi> which words do import, that Chriſt is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his people. So that as Chriſt was brought in, adjoyned in teſtimony and witneſſe with his Saints; in like manner he comes in, as ſuffering with them alſo: So that here is ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the ſuffering of Chriſt, and his witneſſes; For as Chriſt was

               <p>Firſt, they ſhall <hi>looke</hi> upon the dead bodies of the Witneſſes, not as the high Prie and the <hi>Jewes</hi> did upon Chriſt, with <hi>diſdaine</hi> and <hi>ſcorne,</hi> Lu. 23. 25. <hi>The people with the Prieſts, beholding of him, derided him;</hi> but rather theſe <hi>looke</hi> upon them with <hi>delight</hi> and affectation, and as it's expreſſed in the next verſe, they <hi>rejoyce over</hi> them: they make theſe dead bodies, or outward Carkaſe of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, to be the very object of their joy and delight: they live upon theſe Carkaſſes, they uphold them as their very life and comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſhall not ſuffer theſe dead bodies to be put in graves: this commonly is done in diſ-favour and ſcorn, it was ſpoken it was ſpoken to the indignity of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchs, that they ſhould be caſt <hi>out of their graves as on abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable

branch,</hi> Iſſa. 14. 19. But I take the meaning here in the contrary ſenſe, that they kept theſe dead bodies above ground out of favour and liking, that they might ſee them, and ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch a pleaſing object.</p>
               <p>Theſe are they that poſſeſs the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, and will not ſuffer the dead bodies to be buried; the outward fleſhly form of the Witneſſes they will not let paſs out of their ſight, it is their life and Religion; the life and ſpirit of theſe things that were wont to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, is departed, and therefore they will not part with the externall forme that the Witneſſes did once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter in. Theſe outward forms and figures of worſhip they will keep above ground, and will not ſuffer them to be put in graves. <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired, that when <hi>Sarah</hi> was dead, ſhee might be <hi>buried out of his ſight,</hi> Gen. 23. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſight of his Wife was a griefe unto him: but it is not ſo here with thoſe that manage the cauſe of the Beaſt, they preſerve the dead bodies of the Witneſſes, that they may from the Carkaſs or formes of the Saints, frame out, and ſet up a Religion unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119934:131"/>
and therefore, though they ſlay the teſtimonie of the Witneſſes that did vex and trouble them, yet they keepe their bodies above ground, that they might live, and be comforted by them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how long theſe ſhall ſee their dead bodies, and hinder their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, that is, <hi>three dayes and a halfe,</hi> which is ſpoken indefinitely and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate: and as in Propheſie days are taken for years, ſo here it is meant of <hi>three yeares</hi> and a <hi>halfe,</hi> and ſo hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>wiſdome and abilities of men, are exerciſed about the dead bodies of the Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is all the ſtudie and care that men take, what do they ſpend their time and parts about, but concerning theſe dead bodies; yea, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of men, Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues; theſe with all their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and greatneſs, with all their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wiſdome, they are all employd about the Carkaſs, or externall forme of things: All the ſyllogiſticall reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and disputes, all the maximes and rules that worldly men are exerciſed in, what are they, but the very forme and figure, the ſuperficiall and extern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all part of thoſe things, that the Saints have in their time adminiſtred in: now the Gentiles come to poſſeſs the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, and all their paines and endeavours they uſe about it, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it, and make it glorious in the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That the great care that thoſe of the Nations and Tongues,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119934:132"/>
                  <hi>take about the dead bodies of the Witneſſes, is to keepe them above ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The remembrance and ſight of theſe are very deare and precious to the world: theſe are their very life, peace, and joy, they cannot live or enjoy themſelves without them. The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall formes of Religion, that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have ſometimes given forth their teſtimonie by, and having laid them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the world doth with much gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe take up to uſe them, and to make them their very ſtay &amp; comfort. I have obſerved, that the Saints did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt aſide any externall form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that ſometimes they have been exerciſed in; but worldly Chriſtians did readily embrace them, they uſe them; they keep them above ground, and will not ſuffer them to be put in graves, becauſe they cannot ſubſiſt without theſe, their very life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is upheld by theſe dead bodies, by theſe Carkaſſes, or outward things. Hence it is, that when the Witneſſes have caſt aſide ſome formall wayes of worſhip; what is the queſtion of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſors? what Religion ſhall we be of now, ſay they? when ſhall we be

Alas, their Religion and life is gon, if the external from be taken away: They will not ſuffer theſe to be put in graves, if they can with all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonrs keep theſe bodies above ground: and why? the life and ſpirit of theſe things is departed, with the Witneſſes laying of them down, ſo the world is willing to embrace them: So long as the Witneſſes uſed them, and there was ſome ſpirit and life in them, it tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and vexed the worldly people, they continually oppoſed the Witneſſes in thoſe very wayes and formes that now they take up themſelves: they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecuted the ſpirit and teſtimony of the Saints, but their Carkaſes they keep above ground; for alas, take away theſe, you take away their Religion, their life, and all they have: they have but the outward Court to poſſeſs, and if you deprive them of that, they have nothing left: No wonder then, if worldly Chriſtians will not ſuffer the dead bodies of the Witneſſes to be put in graves. Now what is all the work and labour of thoſe that manage the cauſe of the beaſt? but this, that after they have-ſlain the teſtimony of the

Saints, to advance the fleſhly part, and outward Carkaſs of heavenly things, in relation to their owne advantage.</p>
               <p>It's ſaid in verſ. 18. <hi>The nations were angry, for his wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they ſhouid be judged.</hi> All the Ordinances and Worſhips, all the rules and authorities, all the orders and ſervices of Antichriſt, are but <hi>dead</hi> things, and ſhall be judged as <hi>dead,</hi> having nothing of the light of life of God in them.

                  </gap> of Satan. Theſe are ſaid to <hi>dwell upon the earth,</hi> Rev. 12. 12. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 8. The Antichriſtian Church and faction are ſaid to dwell upon the earth, becauſe they are earthly and carnall, in oppoſition to the Saints, who are ſaid to dwell in heaven. The Witneſſes are ſtiled ſuch as <hi>dwell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Chap.</hi> 18. 20. And thoſe that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt, being their oppoſites, are ſtiled, thoſe that <hi>dwell upon the earth.</hi> The Saints under heavenly enjoym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, heavenly diſcoveries of truth and light, theſe dwell in Heaven, in the glorious Temple, in the holy taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God.</p>
               <p>But the Antichriſtian Church, and all the members thereof are caſt out of heaven unto the earth, there they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119934:135"/>
and dwell; they favour of the earth, having earthly enjoyments, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall delights; their condition, ſtate, worſhip, and contentment conſiſting all of earthly things. The earth is their portion, and they make their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the carriage of theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, towards the Witneſſes dead bodies: they <hi>rejoyce over them, make merry, and ſend gifts one to another.</hi> This is an alluſion to the practice of the Jewes, when they had procured deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the contrivances of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> they ſolemnly feaſted, <hi>rejoyced, and made merry, ſending portions one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> Heſt. 18. 19. So when the Lord had reſtored unto the Jewes their land, their Citie, the Temple, and worſhip; <hi>The people went their way to eate, and to drinke, and to ſend portions, and to make great mirth, Neh.</hi> 8. 12. Suitable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is that of the Prodigall, who when he came home, the Father for joy kils the <hi>fatted Calfe, and they rejoyce and make merry together,</hi> Luk. 15. 24. So here the inhabitauts of the earth doe ſo well reſent their killing, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Witneſses, as that they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119934:136"/>
rejoyce and make merry, even as thoſe that have obtained ſomeemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent deliverance, or that have received ſome excellent good thing, or as if they had obtained ſome great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table victory, they ſet up ſome Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies or Enſignes of Conqueſt. And this they expreſſe in a feaſtival manner, <hi>They eate, and drinke, and are merry, and ſend portions one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumme of all is this; that when the Adverſaries ſhall think upon the dead bodies of the Witneſſes, that they maintain and keep them above ground without the true life and ſpirit, they ſhall excceedingly triumph, and make feaſts in token of joy, as in the old time; and if they doe not this literally, yet they ſhall as much, and as really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, as they that did ſuch things; and not only ſo, but do what they can to make others rejoyce with them.</p>
               <p>3.

and killed theſe Witneſſes of God, that had alwayes tormented them; now they thought they were rid of them, and ſhould not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with them any more, therefore it is, that they of the earth do ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoyce. The Witneſſes torment the earth by inflicting juſt puniſhment and reward upon thoſe that worſhip the Beaſt. Their very witneſſe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is a great torment to the world. The wine of Gods wrath, and the cup of his indignation ſhall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the earth: and what is all this, but the powring forth of the Vials, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the propheſie of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: As they turned waters into blood, and plagued the Earth with all plagues, as we heard before, ſo they torment the earth by their witneſſe and propheſie: Good reaſon hath the world to rejoyce, when they can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the courſe of their teſtimomonie, and keepe their bodies out of graves, to their owne advantage and uſe. From the words thus opened, take theſe few Obſervations.</p>

They are a generation that doe ariſe from the earth, and they are earthly, they neither know nor favour the things of God. Their Church is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, their Ordinances are but inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their Government is but a worldly power, all the whole forme of ſervice and worſhip is but of an earthly and humane inſtitution.

Thus they turn their ſweete waters into blood and contention, as we heard before, and plague the earth with all plagues; they pour out whole vials of wrath upon all the worſhips and ways of Antichriſt.

               <p>Firſt, the <hi>time</hi> when they ſhall riſe, and that's <hi>After three dayes and a halfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:119934:139"/>Secondly, the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>meanes</hi> by which they ſhall riſe, and that is, <hi>The ſpirit of life from God entred into them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we have their reſurrection it ſelfe, expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>And they ſtood upon their feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, we have the conſequent or ſequell thereof: <hi>And great feare fell upon them that ſaw them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>time</hi> or ſeaſon of the riſing of theſe witneſſes, it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>three dayes and a halfe,</hi> which <hi>terme</hi> of time hath been opened alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as you heard, holds proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>forty two moneths,</hi> And with 1260 dayes, and with a <hi>time, times,</hi> and <hi>halfe a time.</hi> All the time of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full raigne of the beaſt, the witneſſes propheſie in ſackcloth, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies killing and ſlaying, they lie dead in the great Citie, and their bodies are kept above ground for the ſpace of <hi>three dayes</hi> and <hi>a halfe,</hi> which holds a juſt proportion with the time of the womans being in the wilderneſſe, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 14. expreſſed by a <hi>time, times,</hi> and <hi>halfe a time.</hi> After which time of ſorrow and ſadneſſe, that ſhall befall theſe witneſſes, they ſhall rejoyce, for they ſhall riſe againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:119934:140"/>Now in that it's ſayd, <hi>After three dayes and a halfe,</hi> it doth ſeem to imply, an earneſt expectation in the witneſſes of their reſurrection, when the time ſhall draw neer, when the laſt period of time ſhall come, of their ſadneſſe and mourning, then ſuddenly they ſhall expect a time of riſing and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. Before the time they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect deliverance: but when it draweth neer, then they are exceedingly taken up in the expectation of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>meanes</hi> of their reſurrection, <hi>The ſpirit of life from God entred into them.</hi> After this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſpirit of life;</hi> or as the Hebrews call it, the <hi>breath of life;</hi> as it's ſayd, <hi>God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into man the breath of life,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. when he made man a living ſoule. So when the Lord doth raiſe up his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from their ſtate of ſadneſſe and ſackcloth, he breathes into them the breath of life. The breath of God, is the ſpirit of God, and the breath of life, is the power and operation of that ſpirit. Life is nothing but the ſoules communion with God. The body is dead without the ſpirit, ſo is the ſoule without Ghd. The conjunction of ſoule
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119934:140"/>
and body is life; ſo the union of the ſoule with God is divine life. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith, <hi>In thy preſence there is life.</hi> And marke it, he doth not ſay, the <hi>ſpirit of propheſie,</hi> ſuch whereby they did only ſee things remotely, foretelling what ſhould come to paſſe in after times: but the <hi>ſpirit of life from God entred into them.</hi> The mighty and powerfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, cauſeth theſe witneſſes to live: it is not that ſpirit, whereby they ſhould ſay, we ſhall live hereafter, or whereby they ſhould wiſh, O that we might live but the ſpirit of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they <hi>doe</hi> live, and they know they live; I ſay, this mighty, powerfull and glorious ſpirit of life, ſhining forth upon their hearts, living and operating in them, this ſhall cauſe them to ariſe from ſhame and ſorrow, even from that meane, low, and poore condition they were in, prophecying in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. It is then, the divine preſence, the ſpirit and life of God, the glorious ſhining forth of this face and love, that occaſions the reſurrection of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we come to the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe, and that is expreſſed in theſe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119934:141"/>
words; <hi>And they ſtood upon their feet.</hi> We cannot underſtand this of a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection properly ſo called; but as the ſlaying and death of the witneſſes was myſticall; ſuch alſo muſt their reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be. Then it cannot be meant of a bodily or fleſhly reſurrection; but of that which is myſticall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; namely, a reſurrection from ſhame and miſery, from bondage and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from their meane, low, weake, and fackcloth condition, unto a ſtate of more perfection and liberty, of more glory &amp; light; their condition ſhould be much more glorious and excellent, then it was before. From this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>And they ſtood upon their feet;</hi> note two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it notes a riſing from a poore, low, meane, captivated condition, as plainly appeares from that place, from whence theſe words are borrowed, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek</hi> 37. 10. when the Prophet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to propheſie unto the foure winds, to breath upon the <hi>ſlaine,</hi> and upon the <hi>dry bones,</hi> that they <hi>might live.</hi> The dry bones, and the ſlaine are the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Babyloniſh captivity, they were as ſlaine, and as a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119934:141"/>
dead body: (even as the witneſſes are under the tyranny of Myſticall Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon) now it is by the breath of God, entering into theſe dry bones, that they are made to live: the breath of life being in them, they <hi>ſtand upon their feet.</hi> That notes their reſurrection from the meane and loſt condition under the oppreſſion of their enemies. Hence they are ſayd, to <hi>ariſe out of their graves,</hi> verſ. 12. So the witneſſes being but as dead bodies, and as dry bones, under the tyranny and oppreſſion of Antichriſt; but when the ſpirit of life enters into them, they ſtand upon their feet, and ariſe out of bondage &amp; ſhame, into a ſtate of liberty and glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to <hi>ſtand upon their feet,</hi> notes, that they ſhould ſtand by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhould ſtand by that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that knowledge, light and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they ſhould enjoy in themſelves; they ſhould ſtand upon their owne leggs, and not depend upon others; they ſhould not live upon the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, opinion, and knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, but upon their owne light and experience in the things of God. The time was, that the Arke was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119934:142"/>
upon mens ſhoulders, from place to place, untill at laſt it was brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto the Temple, and then it reſted: So the Saints, while prophecying in ſackcloth, under weake and faint diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of truth, did much depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the judgements and opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; but now the ſpirit of God ſhall dwell ſo plentifully in them, that they ſhall live upon their owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the light and life of God in themſelves. The ſpirit of life breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, with much life, with much power and evidence, that they ſhall no longer be carried away with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of other men, but ſhall ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne feet. Thus we ſee, that the reſurrection of theſe witneſſes is firſt, from bondage and miſery, unto liberty and freedome. Secondly, from darkneſſe and meaneſſe, unto light and glory.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt thing here to be conſidered is the <hi>conſequent</hi> or <hi>ſequell</hi> hereof; <hi>And great feare fell upon them that ſaw them.</hi> When the witneſſes were ſlaine, and their dead bodies lying in the ſtreet of the great Citie; The men of the earth could rejoyce, make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119934:142"/>
and triumph; but now at the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſing, the caſe ſhall be otherwiſe with them, now they ſhall feare and tremble, now amazement and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall take hold of them. When the witneſſes were ſlaine, they thought never to heare of them more, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped they ſhould never ariſe; but behold now they riſe againe, and how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth this affright the men of the world; here is terrour and amazement to all that dwell in the earth. Suitable unto this is that paſſage in <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 5. when that judgement was manifeſted upon <hi>Anania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> the Text ſaith; <hi>Great feare fell upon all that heard thoſe things.</hi> Thoſe perſecutours that did vex and trouble the witneſſes, they thought they had made ſure worke of them, that they had been wholly deſtroyed, and that they ſhould never more have been troubled with theſe Prophets; but now to their great griefe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement they riſe againe, and ſtand upon their feet; this doth more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright &amp; trouble the men of the earth, then ever their prophefie did.</p>
               <p>Having thus unfolded the words, we paſſe on to the Obſervations they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119934:143"/>
offer to our Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Obſerve; <hi>That when the time of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obſer.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the witneſſes ſuffering and ſadneſſe drawes to an end, there is an earneſt expectation in them of their reſurrection.</hi> The text doth relate to the time of their reſurrection, when their ſuffering condition ſhall draw to an end. <hi>After three dayes and a halfe,</hi> &amp;c. There is a <hi>day,</hi> and after that <hi>two dayes,</hi> in which the witneſſes are in the middeſt of their ſufferings and perſecutions, their evills are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, and they cannot ſay when they ſhall be delivered, and therefore reſolve to wait with patience, and ſubmit to the will of the Lord. But when the halfe day ſhall come, which ſhall be but ſhort, then theſe witneſſes are brought into a comfortable expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a ſeaſonable and ſpeedy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, when they ſhall plainly ſee, that the witneſſes have been long time in ſlaying, and have been dead, and now ſpeedily ſhall revive and riſe againe. Theſe ſhall be able to ſay, the Lord will cut his worke in righteouſneſſe. It is ſayd, that all <hi>Babylons plagues ſhall come in one day,</hi> Chap. 18 8. that is all in ſome ſhort time, ſuddenly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119934:143"/>
expectation. So ſudden ſhall be the riſing of the witneſſes, when they come to the halfe day, or laſt period of time. Now I am moſt confident, that it is the time of the ſixt Trumpet, in which time the witneſſes are not to be ſlaine, but to ariſe, and aſcend to God, in the cloud; and therefore the great expectation in the ſpirits of many Saints this day, of ſome notable change, and of ſome great manifeſtation of the kingdome of God, doth predict to me, the ſudden riſing of the witneſſes. The three whole dayes of the beaſts raigne are paſt, it's the halfe day, the dividing of time, the time of the image of the beaſt; and therefore the Saints ſhall ſhortly ſing by experience that ſong; <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Revel. 18. 2. The Saints may ſing and rejoyce, their time of deliverance draweth neer; the ſpirit of life appeares in ſome of them already, and ſhall ſhortly ſhine forth in others by a diſcovery of that glory of the Lord that's riſen upon them, &amp; theſe ſhall ſhine forth in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof. Many things in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent words of the Text will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt, that the witneſſes are in riſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:119934:144"/>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>That the witneſſes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>are enabled to ariſe by the mighty powerfull ſpirit of life, from God.</hi> Nothing but the mighty, ſtrong, prevailing ſpirit of life, can cauſe the witneſſes to ariſe. There's no motion, but it flows from life, and there's no true life, but it flows from Chriſt, and his ſpirit. <hi>The firſt Adam was made a living ſoule, the ſecond was made a quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. Chriſt is alive-making ſpirit, it is the ſpirit that makes man to live a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life. This is the true life, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life; all ſpirituall actions flow from this life, it is Chriſt living and acting in the ſoule. Now it is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant flowing forth of this ſpirit of life, that muſt cauſe the witneſſes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. It was the great and powerfull voyce of Chriſt, that cauſed the dead to riſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. So it muſt be the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full quickning, inlivening, filling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving ſpirit of life from Chriſt that brings forth a reſurrection to theſe two witneſſes. It is not a ſmall meaſure of the ſpirit, neither is it a ſpirit of propheſie, as to foretel things to come, or to ſee things at a great diſtance, that will make the witneſſes revive and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119934:144"/>
ſtand upon their feet; but the ſpirit of life, when they ſhall know they live, when all they act &amp; ſpeake flows from that life, their works and ſpeeches are all living, when they are able to ſay, we live, when they can declare the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life from God lives in them, then I ſay, it is that cauſeth the witneſſes to ariſe, when this ſpirit lives in them, whoſe property is to quicken, and cauſe all things to live.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>As there is a time</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>when the witneſſes lie ſlaine and dead; ſo alſo there is a time, when they ſhall revive and live againe.</hi> They ſhall not alwayes be troden underfoot by the men of the earth, and propheſie in ſackcloth, and be ſlaine by the beaſt that ariſeth out of the bottomleſſe pit; and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to lie in the ſtreets of the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they ſhould alwayes be made a ſcorne to their adverſaries; but they ſhall have a riſing time, when they ſhall caſt off their ſack cloth and mourning, they ſhall ſtand upon their feet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; and then their enemies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced over them ſhall weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If their enemies did know this, they could not ſo much triumph over
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119934:145"/>
them. For as the Prophet ſpeakes; <hi>Though they fall, yet they ſhall riſe againe, Mich.</hi> 7. 8. Theſe Prophets of the Lord may be eclipſed for a ſeaſon, and they may give forth their teſtimony faintly and weakly, and in much weakneſſe and darkneſſe; but afterward they breake forth in greater luſtre &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then ever they did before. Though they for a ſpace lie dead, &amp; their bones are dried (as the Prophet ſpeakes of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) yet the Lord will by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his divine power, and by the ſpirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, experience, and aſſurance of the ſpirit of life from God dwelling in them. Now they ſhall not propheſie or foretell of good things to come, or of deliverance at a great diſtance; but they ſhall act and ſpeake in the name
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119934:145"/>
of the Lord, from the anoynting that dwells in them, they ſhall onely move, ſpeake and act by that ſpirit of life, that hath raiſed them from the dead.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, obſerve, <hi>That</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the riſing of the witneſſes, is a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſight to the men of the earth.</hi> The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes now ariſe from ſhame, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tyranny, and how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that their enemies that oppreſſed and tormented them, ſhould be much amazed and affrighted. When <hi>Herod</hi> heard of the works of Chriſt, he was much afraid, ſaying, <hi>It is John whom I have beheaded,</hi> Mark. 6. 16. So when the Lord ſhall raiſe up his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from bondage and ſlavery, from darkneſſe and weakneſſe, and ſhall lift them up into a higher condition; what will the world ſay, are not theſe they that we have perſecuted and ſlaine, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen up in the rule, dominion, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the kingdome of Chriſt. The ſight and beholding of this ſtrikes the world dead, at one blow. This ſight is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all earthly men. When the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to apprehend Chriſt in the garden, and did but heare Chriſt ſay, <hi>I am he; they fell downe backward:</hi> So
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:119934:146"/>
when the men of the earth ſhall heare and ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the poore deſpiſed Saints to ſtand upon their own feet, they ſhall fall backward; they ſhall as <hi>Saul</hi> fall flat upon the earth, they ſhall become heartleſſe &amp; ſpiritleſſe, feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall take hold on them. The propheſie of the witneſſes, though but in ſackcloth, was a great trouble to the men of the earth they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and troubled at that; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were much comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>laying of them, by hindering them in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> courſe of their propheſie. But now when they ſhall ſee them ariſe higher then ever, O! this ſtrikes the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the very heart, this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding terror &amp; amazement to them. There is juſt cauſe for the earth to mourne at the riſing of the witneſſes, becauſe the liberty and glory of theſe, ſhall be their bondage and ſhame: as one of the ſcales of the ballance goes downe, when the other goes up; ſo the honour, proſperity, &amp; dignity of theſe witneſſes, and of carnall men, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent one with the other.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119934:146"/>
doth ſurprize them all, pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of face, and ſadneſſe of heart ſtrikes the men of the earth, when they thought they had ſlaine theſe Saints ſo that they ſhould never riſe more, they thought they had made an utter rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, never to heare of them, never to ſee them more, unleſſe their dead bodies and carkaſes, to make merry withall: but now that theſe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and live againe, the ſight of this, nay the very thought hereof is like a milſtone, that breaks them in pieces, and doth make their hearts to melt, and their ſpirits to faile within them.</p>

                  <item>Thirdly, to <hi>whom</hi> it ſpeakes.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, <hi>what</hi> it ſpeaks.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing to be taken notice off is the <hi>voyce:</hi> This <hi>voyce</hi> is no other then the very call of God, the appointment of the Lord. The great voyce of his ſpirit; 'Tis not like the ſtill voyce, in which God did impart his minde to <hi>Eliah,</hi> or the voyce ſpeaking behinde his people; but a great and mighty voyce, like the ſound of a Trumpet, as it's expreſſed in <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 1, 2. This is a tranſlating voyce, changing the Saints into the voyce it ſelfe, they are ſuch as the voyce is, as <hi>John</hi> confeſſes; <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I was in the ſpirit.</hi> This voyce is the breathing forth of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, the ſpirit of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, calling, enabling, directing the witneſſes to aſcend up to heaven, and accordingly they doe aſcend.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the place from whence this voyce cometh, that's from <hi>heaven,</hi> that ſhews it is a moſt eminent, powerfull, and certaine voyce. It's the voyce of <hi>righteouſneſſe revealed from heaven,</hi> it's
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119934:148"/>
full of certainty, <hi>the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> it's full of excellency, coming from the <hi>excellent glory,</hi> it's powerfull and full of majeſty, it comes from heaven, and brings the power of heaven along with it, it prevailes in the thing, unto which it was ſent, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all, it carries all before it. All the power of the earth is not able to withſtand this great voyce.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take notice unto whom this voyce is ſent; it ſpeaks <hi>unto them;</hi> namely, the <hi>witneſſes</hi> and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord. This voyce ſpeaks onely to the holy ones of God, none elſe can underſtand it's language. Thoſe that accompanied <hi>Paul</hi> in his way to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> in <hi>Act. 9. heard a voyce, but ſaw no man,</hi> neither did they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the voyce, that was ſpoken to <hi>Paul.</hi> So the men of the earth, may heare the outward ſound of this voyce, but they underſtand it not, neither is it ſpoken to them; it's onely ſpoken to the witneſſes, and they heare it, it's directed to them, and they onely underſtand it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what <hi>direction</hi> doth this voyce give forth: it calls the witneſſes
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119934:148"/>
to <hi>aſcend,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come up hither.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid; Come my people, you have been clothed in ſackcloth and aſhes, you have been made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the world, and the Gentiles have trampled you under their feet, you have lived upon the authority and opinion of men, you have lived much below in the earth, you have lived too far and remote from my ſelfe, you have mourned, as in the abſence of the bridegroome; but now you ſhall live ſo no longer; <hi>Come up hither;</hi> live in me, in my glory, in my ſpirit, in my ſtrength, in my kingdome; you ſhall have liberty, peace, and joy in me: come up to me, from under the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from amidſt the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Sodome:</hi> come now, enjoy my ſelfe, my wiſdome, my ſtrength, my kingdome: you ſhall now live upon my holy mountaine, and there ſhall be no deſtroying beaſt, you ſhall not be deſtroyed by your adverſaries, neither ſhall the beaſt, that aſcendeth out of the bottomles pit be able to make war w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> you, to overcome, and kill you any more. Here is the voyce of the Lord,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119934:149"/>
powerfully calling, the boſome of the Lord opened in goodneſſe and love, the face of God ſhining forth in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſweetneſſe, the hand of the Lord effectually reached out, here are the gates of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the kingdome of Chriſt ſet wide open, and all comprehended in this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and precious, in this moſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent and glorious voyce of the Lord, expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>come up hither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee by what means the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are made to aſcend. The mighty voyce of the ſpirit of the Lord, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, calling, and directing them. It comes from heaven; having the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, power, certainty of heaven with it. It ſpeaks to the witneſſes only, becauſe they onely underſtand it, therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to them. And the glorious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it gives forth, it calls up the poore deſpiſed ſervants of the Lord, to live in the power and kingdome of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Come up hither.</hi> We now goe on to that which follows.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered is the aſcention it ſelfe; <hi>And they aſcended up to heaven in a cloud.</hi> In the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119934:149"/>
hereof, wee may conſider three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, their <hi>action,</hi> they <hi>aſcend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the place whether, that's <hi>up to heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the manner of their aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>It's in a cloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their action is to <hi>aſcend,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſome greater acceſſion of honor, dignity, greatneſſe, and proſperity. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> once ſaid, <hi>I will aſcend up to heaven, I will exalt my ſelfe above the clouds,</hi> Iſa. 14. 14. it's meant that he would in his heart be greater in name, honour, ſtrength and dignity, then he had been formerly.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhall aſcend into a ſtate and condition, much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then they had before enjoyed. This aſcention is diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their ſack cloath condition, to that meane and low condition theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> had lived in, while they were under the power and raign of the beaſt. This aſcention is not a carnall or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily tranſmutation, or a motion from place to place, but of a mutation of ſtate and condition; 'tis an aſcention unto more liberty, freedome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119934:150"/>
ſtrength and glory then they had lived in before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the place unto which they are to aſcend, and that's to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> the kingdome of Chriſt is myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called <hi>Heaven.</hi> The Saints are ſaid to dwell in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as Antichriſt is ſaid to dwell in <hi>Earth;</hi> the meaning is, they ſhall aſcend into a more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly condition, of liberty, power, ſtrength, wiſdome, knowledge, light, and life. They ſhall come to poſſeſſe the Kingdome of Chriſt, and enjoy all the immunities thereof. They ſhall live more in heavenly diſcoveries of God and Chriſt, and his will: their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall peace, and internal glory ſhall be very heavenly and glorious. And in this reſpect the Saints that ſhall ſound forth the everlaſting Goſpel, are ſaid to be in the midſt of heaven, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 6. The Saints are called <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 20. The multitude of Saints that ſhall ſing <hi>Allelujah's</hi> and praiſes unto God, upon the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Babylon,</hi> are called a <hi>people that dwell in heaven,</hi> Chap. 19. 1. becauſe they live in heavenly enjoyments and praiſes. So here the Witneſſes are ſaid
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119934:150"/>
to <hi>aſcend up to heaven,</hi> in reſpect of that heavenly and glorious condition and ſtate that the Lord will advance his people unto, when hee ſhal wholly break the power of the beaſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his people to partake of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and dignity of his owne kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee have the <hi>manner</hi> how theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> aſcend, that's in a <hi>cloud.</hi> This great thick <hi>Cloud</hi> that God draws over the Earth, and with which he doth over-ſhadow the face of all things; this is that darkneſs, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, diviſion, conteſt, warre, envie, this I ſay, is that dark cloud, that the Lord hath drawn over the face of the Earth. Hath not God drawn this black cloud upon the affairs, counſels, wiſdome and actions of men; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, government, peace, proſperity of the world is all over-ſhadowed, men know not where they are, nor what they doe, when they goe too faſt, nor when too ſlow; the very hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of men are divided, the world is full of conteſts and wars, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions; and there is ſuch a miſt upon mens ſpirits, that they ſcarce know which way to turn themſelves. It's in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119934:151"/>
this cloud of confuſion, in which the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> do aſcended. We cannot but remember that the Lord brought his people from Aegypt, by dividing of the Sea, by ſeparating of the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: ſo wil the Lord raiſe up his Saints by dividing of the men of the earth, the great Sea, or peoples of the earth, by dividing of them, by confounding of the wiſdome and policie of the world, by daſhing one part of the earth againſt another; I ſay in this manner, and by this means, the Lord will cauſe his faithfull ones to aſcend.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we have that ſpecial <hi>Adjunct</hi> that is hereunto annexed: <hi>And their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beheld them.</hi> By their <hi>enemies,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>People, Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues,</hi> with all the inhabitants of the Earth: All worldly, carnall, Antichriſtian men, theſe ſhall <hi>behold them</hi> to their griefe and vexation. This is mentioned firſt, as to the torment and exceſſive grief that the Adverſaries ſhall take, when they ſhall ſee them that they have deſpiſed, trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and contemned, to be lifted up, to aſcend unto honour and dignity, unto life and glory. And ſecondly,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119934:151"/>
it's mentioned in the praiſe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of thoſe that doe aſcend in the view of their Adverſaries: As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes it an augmentation of bounty, that the Lord ſhould <hi>ſpread his table in the midſt of his foes,</hi> Pſal. 23. So this is an addition to their honour, they ſhall aſcend in the midſt of their Adverſaries, in their view, and before their eye. This is the ſaddeſt ſight that earthly men can behold; they ſhall ſee them aſcend, and ſhall not be able to ſtop their paſſage: this ſhall be as worm-wood, as gall and bitterneſſe to their ſpirits, this ſhall even make them gnaſh their teeth, but they ſhal not be able to help themſelves. The words being thus far opened, we now come to raiſe ſome obſervations from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, obſerve, <hi>That the Witneſſes are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>enabled to aſcend by the powerfull voyce of the ſpirit of God.</hi> They can never riſe nor aſcend, until they are called up to the Lord by this great voyce, this loud heavenly voyce, this voyce of Majeſtie and glory. Antichriſt was able to ſuppreſſe and keepe under theſe two Prophets of the Lord, untill the Lord comes and raiſes them up by his owne
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119934:152"/>
voyce and command. If all the world ſhould call upon them to ariſe, they could not, untill the Lord ſpeake the word, and ſay, <hi>Come up hither.</hi> When the Lod ſpeaks with a heavenly voyce, it is ſo full of love and joy, of light and life, that every thing in the hearts of his, doe heare his voyce; every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, every member, all parts heare and obey. The ſoule is never willing to aſcend, untill the Lord calls by his eternall voyce, and that hath ſuch force and power, ſuch excellency and and majeſtie, that it removes every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the way, and ſets aſide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that would hinder. And again, this voyce is ſo great, ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, carries with it ſo much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the men of the Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder their riſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Lord ſpeak with a powerful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> voyce to the world, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t them come up hither,</hi> all the force, power, policie of men ſhall not hinder them. This voyce is dreadful to the men of the earth, and doth ſo much affright them, that they are forced at laſt (as once <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was) to let the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God goe, and aſcend out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119934:152"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from bondage to liberty, from weakneſſe to ſtrength, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to dominion, from light to darkneſſe, from Earth to Heaven. Now the Saints are taken up to live in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comforts and joyes, in heavenly diſcoveries of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight and life, in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immunities and priviledges. And all this is done by the great, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and powerful voyce of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerve, from the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe; <hi>That the Witneſſes have their</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Obſerv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>time of triumph and rejoycing, as well as they have a time of ſack cloath and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> When they aſcend, they ſhal ſhake off their ſack-cloath and mourning, they ſhal aſcend farre higher, unto an eſtate of more liberty, honour, peace, and glory, then their former eſtate was. They ſhall not alwayes be made the ſcorne and reproach of the world, and be trodden under foot of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be driven into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their dead bodies to lye in <hi>Aegypt</hi> &amp; <hi>Sodome,</hi> and their Adverſaries to make merry, and rejoyce over their Carkaſſes; but they ſhall be advanced above all the pride &amp; ſcorn of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: wel may their enemies vexe and ſtorm at them, but they are above their reach and danger; theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:119934:153"/>
ſhall be cloathed with honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for all the wrongs and injuries their Adverſaries have put upon them. Now they ſhal ſit upon Chriſts throne, weare Chriſts crown, enjoy Chriſts kingdome: now they ſhal quit the Earth, and aſcend farr above men and feares, above griefs and troubles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſhame and contempt; to live more in God &amp; Chriſt, to enjoy more of his life and righteouſneſſe, to become more inheritors of his Kingdome and glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhall<note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſerv.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:119934:153"/>The externall glory, liberty, and redemption that ſhal attend the Saints in this heavenly condition that they are inſtated in by this aſcention, wee may conſider in theſe particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> upon their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention ſhalbe delivered from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their Adverſaries. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Aegypt, Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall all ceaſe, and be broken in pieces <hi>My people went downe to Egypt, and the Aſſyrian oppreſſed them without cauſe: Now therefore what have I here, ſaith the Lord, that my people are taken away for nought; they that rule over them, make them to howle,</hi> Iſa. 52. 4, 5. <hi>Behold I will bring them againe out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and gather them from the coaſts of Aſſyria; and the pride of Aſſyria ſhall be broken, and the Scepter of Aegypt ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away,</hi> Zach. 10. 10, 11. ſee alſo <hi>Iſa. 10. 24, 25, 26, 27.

                  <hi>Aegypt, Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> were the

               <p>Secondly, God will make thoſe that have perſecuted and trodden under feet the Witneſſes, to ſerve and obey them. <hi>For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet chuſe Iſrael, and ſet them in their owne Land, and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhall be joyned with them, and they ſhall cleave to the houſe of Jacob: and the people ſhall take them, and bring them to their place: and the houſe of Iſrael ſhall poſſeſſe them in the land of the Lord for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and handmaids: and they ſhall take them Captives, whoſe Captives they were, and they ſhall rule over their oppreſſors,</hi> Iſa. 14. 1, 2. <hi>For that nation that will not

               <p>By theſe Scriptures it appears, that the Lord will not alwayes give up the <hi>names</hi> of his people to reproach and infamie: they ſhall not alwayes lie under ſhame and diſgrace; but when the Lord ſhall lift up the head of his poor deſpiſed people, they ſhall have another name, which the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall name, a name of praiſe and glory; when the Lord ſhall adorne his Spouſe with the brightneſſe of the ſun and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make her terrible as an army with banners, then the daughters that ſee

               <p>This ſhall be the ſtate and condition of the Witneſſes, when they ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up to heaven, to live in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments, or liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in reſpect of their outward and externall glory: they ſhalbe freed from the oppreſſion of their Adverſaries.

               <p>Now it followes, that wee ſpeake ſomething of their internal glory and excellency that they ſhal be advanced unto: And that you may, take in theſe particulars following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Saints ſhall abound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly knowledg and underſtanding of the myſteries of truth. <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9. <hi>And he will deſtroy in this mountaine the face of covering caſt over all people, and the Veile that is ſpread over all nations,</hi> Iſa. 25. 7. <hi>Moreover, the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſeven-fold, as the light of ſeven

               <p>There hath been a vaile of covering ſpread over all Nations, and that by the operation of the man of ſinne: but now the vaile ſhall be taken away, and the light of one day ſhall be as the light of ſeven, there ſhall be a perfect diſcovery of light, a perfection of truth ſhall appeare in the Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Saints ſhall be taken up into higher enjoyments of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort and joy, by a clearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of divine love, then when they ſate mourning under the ſenſe of their owne defects. <hi>And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall returne, and come to Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſongs, and everlaſting joyes upon their heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they ſhall obtaine joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>All which places ſhew, that when the Saints ſhall be delivered from the ſpirituall captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſhal have no more occaſion of ſorrow, thoſe evills that expoſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and perſecutions, which lay ſo heavy upon them; and thoſe evills that cauſed them to ſhed ſo many tears ſhall be all done away, they ſhall not now be grieved under oppreſſion, and crying for deliverance: <hi>For their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhall be peace, and their Exactors righteouſneſſe, righteous ones ſhall have the dominion.</hi> Neither ſhall the Saints live under any ſuch apprehenſion of ſinne as now, which cauſes ſoule ſickneſſe: for their iniquity shall be done away, and they shal enjoy ſpiritual freedome and comfort.</p>

               <p>The weake and the feeble ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſo much grace, majeſtie, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſtrength, and truth, that as the very Angels of God, they ſhall be carried forth in the moſt heroicall and divine vertues, that the moſt weak and impotent ſhal be able to take the ſpoyle, and ſeize on the prey of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things; they ſhal not ſaile in any gallant Ship of outward enjoyments, there ſhal be no rowing of the Galley with oares of creature-ſtrength and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: but they ſhal got forth in the name of the Lord, and ſhal in his ſtrength alone performe all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>

They shal not be over-shadowed by the night of ignorance, or perſecution, or darkneſſe, but shal be filled with the in-dwelling of God, and of the Lamb, and they shal walk in the glory of that divine light.</p>

the land of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> our new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Suitable unto our purpoſe is that place, <hi>Iſa. 51. 9, 10. Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arme of the Lord.

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the reſurrection and aſcention of the Witneſſes, we now come to handle the great and notable effect that ſucceedeth thereon, together with ſeverall conſequents thereunto annexed. <hi>The ſame hour there was a great earth-quake, and the tenth part of the Citie fell,</hi> &amp;c. In the handling of which we may conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the time of this Earth-quake, in theſe words; <hi>And the ſame hour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Earth-quake it ſelfe,</hi> mentioned in the Text, <hi>there was a great Earth-quake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the conſequents thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to annexed, and they are three.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The tenth part of the Citie fell.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:119934:162"/>2. <hi>Seven thouſand men are ſlain.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>But firſt, of the time, <hi>The ſame houre there was a great Earth quake.</hi> This <hi>terme</hi> of time is not to be taken reſtrictvely, as if it ſhould be meant of an hour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſo many minutes. Some read <hi>the ſame day;</hi> neither may wee take it for a naturall day of twenty foure hours. It is an indefinite ſpeech, and holds no certainty for the ſpace of time: but it imports, that the time of this great Earth-quake ſhould anſwer the time of the Witneſſes riſing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending up to heaven. Thoſe words expreſſed in <hi>Chap. 17. 12. Theſe receive power one houre with the beaſt,</hi> import the ſame, meaning the whole terme of their raigne with the beaſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the earth-quake it ſelfe follows: <hi>And there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The naturall cauſe of an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> is, when the wind is pent up in the bowels of the earth, and ſeeking vent from thence, breaks forth into violent concuſſions and motions, ſo that the earth ſhakes and rends, contrary to its
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:119934:162"/>
naturall firmeneſſe and ſtability. Of ſuch an Earth-quake we reed, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 1. And the like appeared when Chriſt aroſe from the dead, as it's recorded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28 2.</p>
               <p>But here we are to underſtand a <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall Earth-quake,</hi> a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Kings, Kingdomes, States, Powers, Formes, Goverments, and the very dignities, orders, ſtrengths, and comforts of men. The ſame Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake is meant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 12. And <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. 18. Thus the Lord ſaith, <hi>He will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry land, &amp; all nations,</hi> Hag. 2. 6. This was partly fulfilled when Chriſt came in the fleſh, the heaven of Ceremonies and ſhadows, and of all the Jewiſh worſhip was ſhaken and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; and alſo the earth was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, both Sea and dry land, all the whole earth was full of great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ruines. But this is again to be fulfilled; yet once more will the Lord ſhake heaven and earth: The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Antichriſts worſhip, Church, forme, order and government: And the earth alſo, all thoſe worldly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have engaged to uphold and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119934:163"/>
manage the cauſe of the Beaſt; theſe powers, dominion, authorities and ſtates ſhall be ſhaken alſo. Thus we ſee what wee are to underſtand by this Earth-quake, the great commotions and troubles that ſhal even rend &amp; tear the earth in pieces: all its order, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, government and dominion, both in Church and State ſhall be broken, all ſhalbe turned upſide down by theſe violent breakings forth, that ſhal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon the world at the riſing and aſcending of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>In the third place we have the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of this great Earth-quake in theſe words; <hi>The tenth part of the Citie fell, and in the Earth-quake were ſlaine of men ſeven thouſand; and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This firſt conſequent in order is this, <hi>The tenth part of the Citie fell.</hi> Whereof we are to take notice of three things, <hi>viz.</hi> what is meant,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, by the <hi>City.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, by the <hi>tenth part.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, by the <hi>fall thereof.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, this <hi>City</hi> is great <hi>Babylon,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 5. which is meant
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119934:163"/>
of the whole univerſall power, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and territories of the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church and State. The nations combined together, and gathered into a Church, worſhipping the Beaſt and his image, ſubmitting to his rule and government; this is the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Babylon,</hi> of which we have ſpoken already, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Though <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe hath myſtically ruled over the Nations, hath been the riſe of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and therefore in ſome ſenſe, is meant by the Citie: yet it cannot be taken ſo reſtrictively, but it takes in the whole State and Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, that is called this Citie, the mother of Harlots, that hath corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the earth with her abominations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the Citie (the principall thing here to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after) is variouſly interpreted. Some would have the tenth part to be meant of the Levites part, ſuch a part as was offered to the Prieſts under the Law, as a maintenance of the legall Prieſt-hood. So that hereby the lot or portion of the Prieſt-hood, the chiefeſt and moſt devoted part ſhould fall; that the tribute of Tythes on tenths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119934:164"/>
the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Miniſtry was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſhould fall, and utterly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held at the riſing, and aſcending of the Witneſſes. But by the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the Citie, we may underſtand of the tenth part of the Nations and Peoples that were devoted to the ſervice of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 13. Ten kingdoms give up their power and ſtrength to the beaſt, to ſerve and worſhip him. Now the tenth part of thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Nations, or Peoples, that have wholly given up themſelves to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and have reſigned up their rule, and authority, their worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Beaſt, theſe are here called the <hi>tenth part of the Citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>tenth part</hi> ſhall <hi>fall</hi> by with-drawing themſelves from the yoake and bondage of the ſervice of Antichriſt, as it's foretold of them in <hi>Chap. 17. 16. Theſe ſhall hate the whore, eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe tenne kingdomes or nations that had formerly given up all their ſtrength and power to the Beaſt, and did formerly ſupport Antichriſt, now they ſhall withdraw themſelves again, now they ſhall with one conſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

themſelves for her deſtruction. <hi>For God hath put into their hearts, to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto the beaſt, untill the words of God ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> Chap. 17. 17. The Lord in juſtice gave over the nations to be ſervile to Antichriſt, for an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, untill he had executed all his cruelties, and enjoyed his dominion and tyranny over them; ſo at the end of his determined time, God will put it into the hearts of the nations, to conſent and agree to riſe up unto the deſtruction of all Antichriſtian domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and power. And though theſe nations ſhall not fully &amp; wholly thus riſe up to effect this great worke, to hate the whore, eat her fleſh, and burne her with fire, untill the laſt ſeale be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the laſt Trumpet ſounded, and the laſt Viall powred out, when there ſhall be a finall and totall deſtruction of Antichriſt's power and raigne: yet there ſhall be a tenth part of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God will raiſe up to begin this worke, God will honour ſome nation or nations, firſt to withdraw their power and authority from the ſervice of the beaſt, and to oppoſe his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119934:165"/>
tyranny and oppreſſion, and that at the opening of the ſixt ſeale, the founding of the ſixt Trumpet, the powring forth of the ſixt Viall, at the time in which the witneſſes ſhall begin to riſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend. Now theſe nations that the Lord ſhall firſt begin withall, to raiſe up, to oppoſe the power of the beaſt: I ſay this nation, or nations, is meant here by the tenth part of the Citie. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all Nations ſhall hate the whore, and caſt her off, and burne her fleſh with fire, there ſhall be ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nations, that God will honour with the firſt of his worke, and this is called the tenth part of the Citie, that ſhould <hi>fall,</hi> not onely, by withdrawing their owne power and aſſiſtance; but alſo oppoſing and ſuppreſſing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power of Antichriſt.</p>

               <p>The words being thus far opened, we proceed now to touch upon ſome obſervations clearly offered to us from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, obſerve from the earthquake it ſelfe, <hi>That the riſing and aſcending of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>witneſſes, doth cauſe a great earthquake in the world.</hi> No ſooner doe the witneſſes begin to riſe out of their ſackcloth, &amp; aſcend up to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the earth ſhaks, the world trembles, great concuſſions
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119934:168"/>
and commotions are among the men of the earth, and upon all their affaires. States and Kingdomes, powers and governments, men and intereſts, theſe all ſhake and tremble. The very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of mans peace and joy are ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and broken; the worſhips and wayes, the riches and preferments of the man of ſin, they all expire and die. The powers of the beaſt, whether civill or eccleſiaſticall, they are all ſubdued, and caſt to the earth. All the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magiſtracy, and all falſe ſhews and formes of worſhip ſhall be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and ſhaken in pieces. An earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake is one of the greateſt evils and perplexities that can poſſibly befall the world; the earth being mans center and ſtay: when the very foundation of mans comfort and happineſs is ſhaken, it muſt mightily affrighten &amp; aſtoniſh the men of the world. There is no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an earth quake, for Kings, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Armies, Nations, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, it ſhakes all, yea, rich &amp; poore, high and low, it throws downe every thing that ſtands in it's way, the very bottome and ground-work of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples joy, truſt, comfort, hope, it trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119934:169"/>
and quakes: the root of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, ſtrength, wiſdome, policy is cut in ſunder at once. The foundation of all power, eccleſiaſticall and civill, is ſhaken, the very ſtability of Church, State, Religion, order, government, ſhakes and falls downe unto the earth. And needs muſt it be ſo; for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are the very baſis and pillars of the earth, they were the ſtrength and ſtability of the world: like unto the two pillars in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, the one called <hi>Jachin,</hi> the other <hi>Boaze, 1 King.</hi> 7. 21. that is as much as to ſay, <hi>ſtability</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> which indeed did prefigure the ſtedfaſtneſſe and ſtrength of the Saints. Theſe two Witneſſes while they lived below in the earth, they were the ſtrength and ſuccour of the world, but when they ariſe out of the earth, and aſcend to heaven, then the ſtrength and ſtability of the earth aſcends with them. <hi>The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are diſſolved: I beare up the pillars of it, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 75. 3. The Lord holds up the earth by theſe pillars, namely, his witneſſes, and when he calls them to heaven, to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to live in the liberty and glory
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119934:169"/>
thereof, then the very pillars of the earth are removed, therefore the earth muſt needs quake and tremble. This ſore judgement is ſo terrible and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, that there is no ſhelter or ſuccour, nothing that man hath, or doth enjoy can be ſecure, it is the moſt ſweeping and affrighting evill, it pitties nor ſpares none, but carries all before it. As <hi>Sampſon</hi> carried away the gates of the Citie upon his ſhoulders; ſo theſe two witneſſes when they ariſe from the earth, and leave the world, they carry away with them, the ſtrength, the peace, the comfort, the order, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the earth, and ſo leave the world and Antichriſt in confuſion and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The whole intereſt that the world hath, in all it's enjoyments, is but borrowed from the witneſſes; and when theſe are taken away, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up above their former ſtation, the world falls into ruine and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the time of this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. <hi>The ſame houre,</hi> &amp;c. obſerve, <hi>That</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119934:170"/>
the world, the witneſſes get ground, and aſcend higher and higher; though the world neither know it, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. This great earthquake; that this very day, doth ſhake Kings, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, States, Churches, rules and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, doth plainly demonſtrate, that the witneſſes are now in riſing, that they begin to ſhake off their ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and mourning, they ſtand upon their owne feet, and doe not any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er depend upon other mens ſhoulders: they aſcend above the oppreſſion and powers of their adverſaries, into the glorious priviledges and liberty of Chriſts kingdome. Know that thorow this thicke and darke cloud, that God hath drawne over the earth, and in the midſt of theſe nationall ſtormes and earthquakes, the Lord will ſhine forth more and more, and the Sunſhine of his favour and love ſhall diſplay it's beams upon his Saints, in working out their ſalvation and liberty. God by the plentifull ſhowers of divine grace, and by his diſtillings of his ſpirit upon his people, will burne up that droſſe and fleſhlineſſe in them, which God doth manifeſt in ſome already. And by
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119934:170"/>
this great earthquake will ſo ſhake the powers of the world, that they ſhall not be able to oppreſſe the Saints any longer. O that we could with faith and patience waite a while, and we ſhall behold within a few yeares, yea, in a very ſhort ſpace, what deſolations and devaſtations God will make in the earth.; and what unexpected ſalvations and deliverances he will worke for his people, farre above what his enemies feare, or his people hope for. Therefore I ſay, wait but a while, ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, the Lord will come and will not tarry; for in this very day, of the great earthquake, in the very time now of theſe nationall ſtormes and commotions, are the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſing above their adverſaries, and aſcending up into the heavenly enjoyments &amp; immunities of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the firſt conſequent of this great earthquake: and the <hi>tenth part of the Citie fell:</hi> obſerve, <hi>That nation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that ſhall firſt of all ſhake off and diſclaime the power of Antichriſt, God will honour that nation firſt of all, in raiſing up his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in it.</hi> There is a tenth part of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119934:171"/>
nations, that have formerly given up their power and authority to the beaſt, that ſhall fall off, and diſown that man of ſin, that ſhall withdraw themſelves from the yoke and bondage of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts ſervice, and that in this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, under the ſixt Trumpet; and that before the <hi>ten hornes</hi> ſhall hate the whore, and burne her fleſh with fire. Now I ſay, that nation, or nations, that ſhall firſt ſhake off the yoke of the oppreſſor, and the burden from off their ſhoulder, are the <hi>tenth part of the Citie,</hi> that here is ſayd to fall in the earthquake: The power and dominion of Antichriſt, that this nation, (or tenth part of the Citie) did once yeild and ſubmit unto: now that authority and rule is wholly diſſolved and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. Now I verily believe that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is this tenth part of the Citie; or take <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as being united together into one, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjected under one dominion and government to be the tenth part of the nations, that ſhall firſt withdraw from under the raigne of Antichriſt; for the tenth part is not tied to one nation, but to the tenth part of the nations,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119934:171"/>
that were brought under the power of Antichriſt. And if the tenth part ſhould be meant of <hi>one</hi> nation onely, yet this tenth part is but that nation, that the Lord doth begin his worke in; he will carry his deſigne from nation to nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill the <hi>ten hornes</hi> are all brought to hate the whore, and to burne her fleſh with fire. This indeed is the full accompliſhment, when the forty and two moneths ſhall be ended, and the word of God fulfilled, the whole ten kingdomes ſhall joyne together, to make war with the beaſt, &amp; to give up their power to the ſervice of Chriſts kingdome. But the Lord doth firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a tenth part, that ſhall firſt withdraw it ſelfe from under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power of the beaſt. And I believe, that this Iſland, with the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons adjoyning to it, will be the firſt fruits of the world, that here ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them that be ſaved, ſhall walke in the light thereof, for many nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord, upon the coming downe of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and finall downfall of Antichriſt. Now if it be demanded, why <hi>Germany</hi> or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119934:172"/>
ſome of the reformed churches abroad may not be meant the tenth part of the Citie: to which I anſwer thus; That though thoſe called the reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, have in ſome reſpect, and in ſome things caſt off the ſervice and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beaſt; yet they have not caſt off the image of the beaſt. For if we caſt our eyes upon the reformed Churches abroad, we ſhall ſee a national church, a carnall Miniſtry, worldly Chriſtians, invented ordinances of mans framing, civill and earthly lawes and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, humane and naturall gifts &amp; parts exerciſed: ſo that theſe reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſo much talked of, are but ſome politick and humane frame, that ſets up an image to the beaſt, or Antichriſt coming forth in another forme and ſhape, then that of downright Popery. And therefore we cannot judge any of them to be the tenth part of the Citie, neither can we expect the riſing of the witneſſes to be from thence. Now for as much as <hi>England</hi> is the firſt nation, that is wholly, &amp; thorowly caſting off, and diſowning all Antichriſtian pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and for as much as the Lord hath raiſed up his people in a great meaſure
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:119934:172"/>
from their ſackcloth and mourning, &amp; the Saints here begin to ſtand upon their feet, &amp; to aſcend above the power of their adverſaries, into the liberty of Chriſts kingdome; and in that God hath begun this great earthquake here, ſhaking all powers, both accle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>aſticall and civill: this I ſay, doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that <hi>England</hi> is that tenth part of the Citie, where the witneſſes ſhall firſt riſe out of their ſackcloth &amp; bondage: Now this great earthquake, that had it's firſt beginning here, ſhall continue, and by degrees reach other nations, the Lord will from hence goe on, to ſhake all nations, the ſea, and the dry land; And though <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Dane,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> ſhall combine againſt us, and becompaſſe the Camp of the Saints, and the holy Citie, yet the fire of the Lord ſhall come from heaven and conſume them. The Lord ſhall be unto this Iſland a wall of fire round about, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 5.

When the pillars of Antichriſt are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it muſt needs perplex and trouble thoſe that depended upon them. For when the poore, miſled people, ſhall ſee the men of name, their great rulers throwne downe, and debaſed, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but affright them; when that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ruled them ſhall be ſubdued, when that wiſdome that led them, ſhall be turned into folly, when all the wayes and practiſes they have received ſhall be diſcovered to be frivolous and empty, this cannot chooſe but amaze and aſtoniſh the poore ſeduced rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: now they know not what to doe, nor on whom to depend, neither unto whom to goe for counſell, or upon whoſe judgement to build. Hence it is, that theſe poore ignorant people aske ſuch queſtions as theſe; Of what religion ſhall we be of now? when ſhall we be ſetled? on whom ſhall we truſt?

The experience of our times tells us, that God hath diſcovered ſo much wickedneſſe and oppreſſion in thoſe he hath taken off and ſlaine, that the remnant, and ſeduced multitude, (though they loved them well, and were much affrighted at their fall) cannot but glorifie God, and ſay, theſe were juſtly throwne downe for violence and oppreſſion, theſe have received their juſt demerit and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vengeance: Thus will the common people glorifie the God of heaven, by acknowledging his juſt judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that ruled over them. But as for theſe great and powerfull men themſelves, they never will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the juſt hand of God: they will ſay, of all theſe overturnings and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, they are but <hi>fatum belli:</hi> and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119934:176"/>
thus it happened out unto them: Theſe indeed are filled with anger and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their ſpirits, theſe have their hearts full of vexation and griefe; theſe open their mouths, &amp; blaſpheme God, and his Tabernacle; calling light darkneſſe, and truth error, and the like. Their hearts even die within them with griefe and diſcontent, they weep and lament, becauſe their gaine and merchandiſe is taken away, their honour and profit is wholly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Theſe gnaw their tongues for paine, and ſtand, crying, alas, alas; how is the glorious Citie, with all her order, worſhip, gaine, honour, in one houre made deſolate. Thus ſhall the great ones lament their loſſes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to repent of the <hi>works of their hands, that they had worſhipped Devils, and idols of gold, ſilver, braſſe, and ſtone,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe never come to acknowledge the juſtneſſe of God, hand upon them; but the poore affrighted remnant; theſe, though much perplexed and troubled to ſee what is done, yet they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that all thoſe men of name juſtly ſuffered, and ſo they glorifie the God of heaven in the juſtneſſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119934:176"/>
And as tis externally, ſo it is inwardly and myſteriouſly in man: It's not the wiſdome and excellency of man, its not the parts and gifts, the learning, the greatneſſe of man, that will glorifie God: no, theſe excellent things in man, will ſpeak glory to it ſelfe, it will exalt the creature. But the low, waſted, crucified part of man, will give glory to God, man brought low in his owne conceit, and abaſed, and brought even to a remnant, will glorifie God, and ſuffer the Lord to make himſelfe glorious.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, a <hi>Trumpet</hi> is that with which men ſound to give an alarme, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration unto the battell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 8. Alſo to publiſh or proclaime a thing, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 1. The counterfeit Phariſees when they gave their almes, are ſayd to ſound a Trumpet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119934:181"/>
to the cuſtome of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who when they would gather an aſſembly, or proclaim a matter, did uſe to ſound a Trumpet. So here by the Trumpet ſounding is meant the Saints proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and ſounding forth the word of truth, declaring the teſtimony of Jeſus, and extolling his praiſes. This they doe either by preaching forth or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the truth, or by making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof. Theſe Trumpets doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively follow the ſeales opening: as the vials follow the Trumpets ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The firſt ſeale, firſt Trumpet, firſt viall goe together, and every one of theſe reſpectively in order follow each other. The beginning is with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the ſeals, which is Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and diſcloſing of heavenly and divine truth unto his Saints: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as the ſeals be thus opened to them; they by declaring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of the truth ſo diſcovered to them, are ſaid to ſound forth the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; each Trumpet in his ſeaſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ſeals are opened, and heavenly light and knowledge is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what is meant by the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119934:181"/>
Trumpet.</hi> In <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. we read of the ſounding of the foure firſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. of the fift and ſixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trumpets ſounding: and here we have the ſeventh and laſt Trumpet. So that there is a graduall and orderly ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Trumpets; anſwerable to the opening of the ſeals: when the laſt ſeale ſhall be opened, then the ſeventh Angel comes to ſound the laſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet; which is the higheſt and laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the truth and excellency of God: <hi>Seven</hi> is the number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, of reſt and bleſſedneſſe: the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet</hi> is the proclamation or declaration of the kingdome of Chriſt, cauſed by the Saints ſounding forth, the higheſt and the laſt glory of Chriſts raigne and dominion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we have the effect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet, and <hi>there were great voyces in heaven.</hi> The moſt perfect and exact, the moſt diſtinct and ſweet note of muſick is the tongue of man; there is no ſound ſo perfect and compleat as theſe voyces in heaven; theſe are the voyces of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jahs and praiſes to God. And of theſe voyces here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned we may note three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:119934:182"/>Firſt, they are <hi>great</hi> voyces; they are mighty and powerfull voyces. God once ſpake to <hi>Elijah</hi> in a low ſtill voyce; ſo he hath done unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while they propheſied in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth: but now upon the great and various diſcoveries of God, the Saints are made to ſound forth mighty decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his truth &amp; glory. It is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>The voyce of the Lord thundereth upon many waters, it's powerfull, and full of Majeſty, breaking downe the Cedars of Lebanon, dividing the flames of fire, and making the wilderneſſe to ſhake,</hi> &amp;c. So theſe voyces of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſen, are ſo great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they ſhake the wiſedome, glory, ſtrength, riches, power, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the world. The appearances of God in former time have been faint and low in his people, they have ſeene things at a great diſtance, and have as it were, whiſpered in a low private voyce of the things of the kingdome of Chriſt; but now they ſhall publiſh them on the houſe-top: and as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> could ſay, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God:</hi> ſo ſhall theſe cry aloud, with boldneſſe and confidence, with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119934:182"/>
and liberty, and ſay, the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of this world, are become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> There is no eare, but ſhall heare, and no heart but ſhall tremble at this voyce: Hell and Devills, all the glory of fleſh, and power of the world, ſhall be affrighted and conſumed before this great and mighty voyce.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe voyces are ſayd to be in <hi>heaven:</hi> The witneſſes are riſen and aſcended up into heaven, to live in heavenly diſcoveries and enjoyments, to walke in the light, and to act in the glory of God. Theſe voyces come from the excellent glory, like the voyce that came unto Chriſt at his tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Saints that lived in a poore earthly condition before, under the oppreſſing power of the earth, are now raiſed up into heaven, and there doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over that vengeance, that the Lord executeth upon the earth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reſpect of <hi>Babylons</hi> deſtruction the Saints are thus called upon: <hi>Rejoyce over her thou heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged her,</hi> Revel. 18. 19. Nothing but ſongs of praiſe and glorious voyces of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119934:183"/>
are heard of thoſe that live in heaven, who live in the ſpirit of God, and in the glorious diſcoveries, and divine manifeſtations of the Lord. There can be no voyce from heaven, but it muſt be full of excellency and glory, the voyce of joy and gladneſſe, the voyce of praiſe and triumph. Theſe voyces are heard round about the throne of God; and they ſound forth nothing but the power, throne, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and glory of God. Here is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened, the glory of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and Saints under thoſe heavenly diſpenſations ſinging Allelujahs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The kingdomes of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the kingdomes of Chriſt.</hi> Now they can ſay, the Lord lives, the Lord raigns. <hi>When the Lord ſhall raigne before his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients gloriouſly,</hi> Eſa. 24. 23. The Saints of God, called the <hi>twenty-foure Elders</hi> verſ. 16. are meant by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the Lord will raigne, upon whom the glory of God ſhall ſhine. Now the Ancients, or Elders, being raiſed up by the Ancient of dayes, to ſit with him in heavenly places, will abundantly Trumpet forth the glory of God, and ſing from heaven his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull praiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:119934:183"/>Thirdly, Theſe were <hi>voyces</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not one ſingle voyce, but voyces: a plurality of voyces; and thoſe not a few but many, here are a multitude of voyces: now at the riſing of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Saints are multiplyed, they are not now as a poore few ſcattered people, but they increaſe to thouſands of thouſands, here are multitudes of hearts enlarged, and multitudes of voyces ſounding in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They ſhall not be a poore deſpiſed remnant, who are accounted the off-ſcouring of all things: but now <hi>abundance of the Sea ſhall be converted: and a little one ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong Nation,</hi> Eſa. 60. 5. 22. There ſhall be a miraculous increaſe and multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, that ſhall utter their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, and yet they ſhall all ſing with one voyce, with one tune: all theſe voyces ſound one and the ſame thing, they all concentre in one, they all ſound forth the praiſe and glorie of Chriſt's raigne and kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now before I proceed to ſpeake of the ſubject matter, that theſe voyces do proclaime, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of Chriſt's raigne and kingdome, I ſhall give you
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119934:184"/>
ſome obſervations of what hath been already ſpoken from this verſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the ſucceſſion of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, or the Saints declaring the glory and truth of God, obſerve, <hi>That the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Lord hath alwayes had a people to declare his truth unto the world.</hi> There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſome that did proclaime and profeſſe the truth of Chriſt, though in weakneſſe; yea, the firſt Trumpet hath it's time of ſounding, as well as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. In every age according as the Lord made a diſcovery of his truth, there were ſome ready to give forth a teſtimony thereof before the world. When the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> thought in his owne judgement, there was none left in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beſides himſelfe, there was ſeven thouſand left, that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelfe, that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> So in the ſaddeſt and darkeſt times of Antichriſts raigne, there have been thoſe that have, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their meaſure given forth their teſtimony of the truth. Every Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounding did in ſome meaſure hold forth the glory of the Lord, and every ſuch declaration of truth hath cauſed a viall of wrath to fall upon the man of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:119934:184"/>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That the Lord hath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>manifeſted his truth by degrees;</hi> or <hi>in a graduall way hath cauſed his Saints to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it.</hi> The ſeventh Trumpet, doth imply ſix other Trumpets that went before: and ſo every one is brought forth in it's time and order, untill that of the ſeventh cometh to ſound. The Lord opened one ſeale after another, letting light breake forth, <hi>Minutatim;</hi> by little, and little, and as it were by piecemeals, drop by drop, untill at laſt he comes to open the ſeventh ſeale, by making a perfect and compleat diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his truth. The Saints in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, in the midſt of Antichriſts raign, were under much dimneſſe and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but the Lord in every age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, hath made ſeverall advances of truth, and hath by degrees brought up his people from the ſtate of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and darkneſſe, by making a more full manifeſtation of his truth unto them. So the Saints hold forth the truth of God by degrees, and proceed gradually, from the ſounding of the firſt Trumpet, untill they come to the ſeventh. It is with the Saints in this caſe, as it's ſaid of the waters of the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119934:185"/>
Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. That theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did increaſe, and ariſe firſt to the ancles, then to the knees, afterwards as high as a mans loyns; at laſt the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aroſe to that height, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a mighty river, wherein a man might ſwim, and without which he could not paſſe over them. So that the Saints under the firſt, ſecond, &amp; third Trumpets, did all hold forth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth, and according to their meaſures did give a teſtimony thereunto, though but in ſome ſmall, weake, and faint diſcoveries of it, and more in the letter, then in the ſpirit. Theſe were glorious lights alſo, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the darkneſſe of thoſe ages and generations they lived in: but yet in reſpect of that light diſcovered, and that declaration of the truth made out by the Saints under the ſixt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet, they were under much darkneſſe and weakneſſe, not being come up to that degree of light, that the Lord hath of late diſcovered, and will make knowne unto his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, obſerve, <hi>There ſhall be a moſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>compleat and glorious diſcovery and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, made out by the Saints under
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:119934:185"/>
the ſeventh Trumpet.</hi> The ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are all comprehended in one: the laſt Trumpet includes all the former. <hi>Seven,</hi> as you heard, is the number of perfection and reſt: So all the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are involved, and wrapt up in this laſt. The ſeventh ſeale is the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of truth, &amp; the ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is the higheſt and moſt perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, by which the Saints do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, and make it forth. Suitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this is that Propheſie, <hi>Eſa. 30. 26. Moreover the light of the Moone ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſevenfold, as the light of ſeven dayes.</hi> So that here is ſeven dayes brought into one day, and one day ſhall have the light of ſeven. So that the laſt and higheſt diſcovery of truth, ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the former. The ſeventh and laſt Trumpet ſignifies the higheſt declaration of the glory of God, the truth and kingdome of Jeſus, that ever the Saints publiſh or ſing forth: it is the breaking forth of the higheſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and greateſt glory of God. In this great and laſt diſpenſation, the Saints obtaine a fuller meaſure of the ſpirit then ever, they are now ſevenfold more
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:119934:186"/>
enabled to proclaime the glory, power and kingdome of Chriſt, then ever they could doe in former time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from the great voyces heard in heaven, obſerve, <hi>That the Saints</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Obſerv:</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>fully riſen, and aſcended up into heavenly injoyments, at the finall deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſhall with one harmonious and ſweet conſent, ſound forth the praiſes and glory of Chriſt'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> kingdome.</hi> Indeed the Saints could alwayes ſing, while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in ſackcloth, but it was like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he ſung of his deep waters, ſo it was of their afflictions and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung in priſon, they had weake and faint joy, in the middeſt of their ſufferings. But now the Saints in heaven, they cry out, they ſing aloud, and ſhout for joy. Theſe voyces be full of power and authority, the world, and it's ſtrength and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation trembles to heare them, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the ſtrengths, the powers, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of men, are ſhaken by them. So great and powerfull are theſe voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that as it was ſaid of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, The voyce of a King is among them; they ſing forth the grace, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the authority, and glory of Chriſt's
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:119934:186"/>
kingdome, ſaying, <hi>The kingdomes of this world are become our Lords,</hi> &amp;c. The Saints are ſayd in <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 3. To <hi>ſing the ſong of Moſes, and the ſong of the Lamb.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſung forth the praiſes of God, for delivering his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their enemies the <hi>Aegyptians, Exod.</hi> 15. ſo his people ſhall ſing forth the praiſes of his power and greatneſs, for delivering them from Antichriſt's yoke and tyranny. And the <hi>ſong of the Lamb,</hi> who worketh <hi>great</hi> and <hi>marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things,</hi> to the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, whoſe cruelty and oppreſſion he had long ſuffered. They ſhall extoll him, as being King of Saints, and ſhall acknowledge him juſt, in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments puniſhing Antichriſt, and in his wayes true, in performing all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made unto his people.</p>
               <p>Having given you the obſervations from the former part of the verſe, namely, from the ſeventh Trumpet, and the voyces heard in heaven: I now proceed to ſpeake of the ſubject matter of theſe voyces.</p>
               <q>The kingdomes of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the kingdomes of our Lord,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:119934:187"/>
and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall raigne for ever and ever.</q>
               <p>Theſe words containe a glorious proclamation or declaration of the kingdome and raigne of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may take notice of theſe ſix par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What is meant by the <hi>kingdomes of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, How theſe <hi>kingdomes</hi> have been detained from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How Chriſt will recover theſe <hi>kingdomes</hi> to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By what right Chriſt ſhall poſſeſſe them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> of Chriſts raigne.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The <hi>time</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of his raigne.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt thing, namely, what is meant by the <hi>kingdomes of this world?</hi> we may eaſily perceive what they are, by oppoſing them to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt: for theſe kingdomes of the world are diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, and contradiſtinct to the kingdome of Chriſt. The kingdome of Chriſt is of a heavenly and ſpirituall nature,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119934:187"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. It's King, Laws, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſubjects are all ſpirituall: it's ſet up and advanced by no humane force or power, but by that which is meerly divine, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 45. Now the kingdomes of this world, are called the <hi>kingdomes of men,</hi> conſiſting of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glory, riches, ſtrength, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, policy, that men by humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer have ſet up, and doth act by. In a word, all the wiſdome and policy, all rule and government, all power and ſtrength, all Conſtitutions and Lawes, all the riches and glory of men, of theſe are made up and formed the kingdoms of this world, called the <hi>kingdomes of men,</hi> Dan. 4. 25. conſiſting of worldly greatneſſe, externall glory, humane policy, outward ſtrength, advanced into the forme of rule &amp; government, acted and brought forth by man, this is the ſtate, glory, and kingdome of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How theſe kingdomes have been detained from Chriſt; and that's thus: whereas Chriſt hath given forth his power by earthly men, as by Kings and Princes of the earth: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that place in <hi>Pro. 8. 15, 16. By
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:119934:188"/>
me Kings reigne, and Princes decree juſtice: by me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth.</hi> Theſe have been the ſubſtitutes and deputies of Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received all their wiſdome, their ſtrength, their authority, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, the Lord hath by theſe adminiſtred unto the world, even by carnall, fleſhly, wicked men, by the Kings of the earth: the Lord hath not adminiſtred by his people, but by thoſe that have raigned as Kings and Princes of the world. Now this being ſo, theſe Kings of the earth, have committed fornication with the whore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2. having mixed and joyned their power with hers, and have with one conſent and minde given up their power and ſtrength unto the beaſt; as is declared <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. to ſerve his ends and deſignes. And though it be true, that all this while Chriſt hath intermedled with all the affaires of the Nations, their policies and governments, that all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currances therein hath tended, at leaſt by degrees, to advance his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to bring about his owne ends: yet theſe kingdomes and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and governments have ſerved An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:119934:188"/>
and it hath been their worke and buſineſſe to oppoſe the kingdome of Chriſt, and ſuppreſſe and perſecute his people and truth: ſo that theſe kingdomes of the world have not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt, though Chriſt hath ſerved himſelfe by them; but they have been devoted unto Antichriſt, and ſerved him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How doth Chriſt recover theſe againe into his owne hand. And that is by breaking and ſcattering the powers of the world; he will <hi>ſhake all Nations,</hi> Hag. 2. 6. when the Lord ſhall caſt aſide theſe oppreſſing tyrants of the earth, he will come forth in the miniſtry of his owne people, and by them, adminiſter righteouſneſſe and peace unto the world. The Lord will daſh in pieces all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the powers of the earth, that have oppreſſed his people, and will ſo come forth in his owne people to adminiſter to the world, that the earth ſhall be at reſt and quiet, when violence ſhall be no more heard in the Land, but our officers ſhall be righteouſneſſe, and our exactors peace. And how ſhall this be? See what the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24. 21,

22, 23. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the Lord ſhall puniſh the hoſt of the high ones, that are on high; and the Kings of the earth upon the earth: and they ſhall be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as priſoners are gathered in the pit, and ſhall be ſhut up in the priſon and after many dayes they ſhal be viſited,</hi> or <hi>found wanting,</hi> as the margent reads it. <hi>Then the Moone ſhall be confounded, and the Sunne aſhamed, when the Lord of hoſt ſhall raigne in Mount Zion, and in Jeruſalem, and before his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents gloriouſly:</hi> or as the Margine renders it, <hi>There ſhall be glory before his ancients.</hi> The meaning of theſe words take thus: The great and mighty Kings of the earth, who have oppoſed the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, and have undertaken all power eccleſiaſticall and civill, to rule in Church and State, to determine all ſpirituall cauſes by temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and civill ſanction: God will ſo advance his Saints, by his ſpirituall appearance in them, that they ſhall oppoſe and puniſh theſe Kings of the earth, not onely by the ſword of the ſpirit, but alſo with a temporal ſword, <hi>the Kings of the earth</hi> upon the earth, they ſhall be able to overcome thoſe that did enſlave and rule over them.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:119934:189"/>
                  <hi>He that kills by the ſword ſhall be killed by the ſword: here is the patience of the Saints: Revel.</hi> 13. 10. This is the fruit of all their patience, in all their former ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. <hi>And after many dayes they ſhall be found wanting:</hi> men ſhall after a time be willing to beare the loſſe of Kings, and great ones, without trouble or vexing: when the <hi>Moone ſhall be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Sun aſhamed:</hi> viz. all civill &amp; eccleſiaſticall powers, governments, orders, and rulers ſhall be broken. Then the Lord ſhall raigne in <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> to wit, in his Saints and people, as before his <hi>ancients,</hi> in whom he ſhall gloriouſly appeare, to adminiſter righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe &amp; peace unto the world.

                  </gap>umph. So that the Lord will no longer come forth in, and by the men of the earth, to raigne by Kings and Potentates, but he will come forth in his glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in his Saints, and thorow them will adminiſter righteouſneſſe to the world. Sutable hereunto is that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119934:190"/>
Scripture, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 22. where it is ſayd, that the little horne ſhould make war with the Saints, and prevaile againſt them, <hi>untill the Ancient of dayes ſhould come,</hi> and then, <hi>judgement was given to the Saints of the moſt high, and the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the kingdome.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe ſhall inherit all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and he will put his people in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all power, riches, rule, and dominion. When the Lord ſhall take away power and dominion from the men of the earth: <hi>Then the kingdome and dominion, and the greatneſſe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe kingdome is an ever laſting kingdome, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him,</hi> verſ. 27. All that's good and excellent, that's rich and beautifull, that's noble and honourable, ſhall be given to the Saints. <hi>The forces of the Gentiles, and their Kings ſhall be brought to them,</hi> Eſa. 60. 11. <hi>And they ſhall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and boaſt themſelves in their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> Eſa. 61. 6. All Dominions and States ſhall ſerve them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ſtrangers ſhall ſtand and feed their flock and the ſonnes of the alient ſhall be their plow-men and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119934:190"/>
dreſſers,</hi> verſ. 5. So then when the Lord ſhall take the power, riches, dominion, and authority, from the great ones of the earth, and inveſt his Saints with the ſame, when all power &amp; rule ſhall be brought under the feet of Chriſt, who will come forth in the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his people; then Chriſt doth take to himſelfe his great power and raign. Thus the Lord doth recover the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and nations into his own hand; ſtripping the men of the earth with their ſtrength, riches, glorie, rule, and conferring of the ſame upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſo will adminiſter no longer by Kings and Nobles, but by Saints and faithfull ones: <hi>He</hi> will raigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Ancients gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By what right or title Chriſt will lay claime to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world; and that is, by his owne native and proper right: Theſe kingdomes ſhall become the kingdoms of <hi>our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall right and propriety of all the kingdomes of the world are the Lords: they are his right, and he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his owne priviledge and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative: he will take to himſelfe and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119934:191"/>
poſſeſſe all: they of right belong unto him, and he from the beginning did poſſeſſe all: It is true the Lord did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt Kings and great ones of the earth to be his Subſtitutes and Stewards; he committed the care of theſe to them as his Servants or Deputies: but when the Lord will caſt theſe Stewards out of their places, &amp; diſpoſſeſſe the Kings and Nobles of the earth, then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the kingdomes of the world returne to him, whoſe they were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. But theſe kingdomes of the world are ſo the Lords, as they are Chriſt's alſo: Chriſt the anointed one of the Lord he ſhall raigne; he is ſon over his owne houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. He hath right and propriety with the Father, by vertue of Sonſhip and anointing: The actuall adminiſtration is put into his hand: he being indued with <hi>all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in heaven and earth,</hi> Matth. 28. 18. Chriſt hath not onely propriety in the holy Citie, but the ends of the earth are his poſſeſſion. Now all the Saints are the <hi>anointed</hi> of the Lord, gathered up into that one anointed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall raigne with Chriſt: as it's ſayd, <hi>He hath made us Kings and Prieſts
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119934:191"/>
to our God, and we ſhall raigne on the earth, Revel.</hi> 5. 10. The Lord ſhall raigne, and his <hi>Chirſt</hi> muſt raigne: and all the Saints, the anointed ones of the Lord; theſe being all comprehended in the one anointed Chriſt, theſe ſhall raigne with the Lord. As the Lord comes forth in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt in his Saints: ſo the Saints ſhall aſcend into Chriſt, and Chriſt into the Father, and ſo all in one, they raign in the glory of God, whereupon the ſpeech of Chriſt ſhall be eminently fullfilled in <hi>Joh. 14. 20. At that day ye ſhall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> The power of God falls upon Chriſt, and Chriſt becomes a quickning ſpirit in all his Saints, that he might by his power put forth in them, rule over the Nations. So that we ſee the right of all Nations belongs to the Lord origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and to Chriſt his anointed; and to all Saints, as being the anointed ones of the Lord, they all making up the fulneſs of the anointed one of God. Theſe have right to all the glory, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, riches, excellencies of the earth, it's theirs, they ſhall poſſeſſe the power and ſtrength, the riches and glory of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119934:192"/>
the earth; theſe ſhall raigne, and the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of God. Then there are none have right unto the kingdomes of the world, but the Lord and his anointed: all other are but pictures and images of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rule; their power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was lent them from the Lord, and now he will take it againe to himſelfe, whoſe owne it is; now he will caſt forth the men of the earth, and ſhake them from the ſeat of greatneſſe and dominion: and now the kingdomes of the world ſhall be given to the holy ones of God, to the anointed of the Lord, and they onely ſhall raigne.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Manner of Chriſt's raigne is that to be ſpoken off in the next place: that Chriſt ſhall raigne in, and by his Saints: for they having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſhall ſit downe upon Chriſt's throne, as Chriſt hath overcome, and is ſet downe upon his Fathers throne, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 21. The <hi>Saints ſhall judge the world, and Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 2. That is, they ſhall not onely judge poore, low, earthly things, but things of an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and moſt excellent nature. It's the Lord through his Saints that ſhall
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119934:192"/>
                  <hi>judge the Nations with righteouſneſſe, and governe the people with truth,</hi> Pſal. 67. 4. 7. This glorious diſpenſation of Chriſt ſhall be adminiſtred by his Saints: the Saints, or the Lord in them ſhall judge the world: that is they ſhall fuſt of all deſtroy and throw downe all confuſion and diſorder; and afterwards ſave and governe the world, they ſhall give ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in the Nations, by a right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all things, civill and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Now as for the perſonall and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reigne of Chriſt, that is aſſerted by many Godly men, (whom I love and honour) I ſhall not at all undertake, either to affirme or deny that opinion: but I ſhall ſay with them, the kingdome of Chriſt is at hand, I dare not ſay, it is a far off, though I cannot deſcribe the manner of it: but of the ſpirituall raigne of Chriſt (which none deny) I ſhall ſpeake off, from theſe foure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſpirituall reigne ſeemes (to me) to be the moſt glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and manifeſtation of Chriſt unto his people: and hence the Apoſtle did not deſire to know Chriſt any more after the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. And
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119934:193"/>
therefore I believe, that Chriſt by the ſpirituall manifeſting of himſelfe, in and through his Saints, will firſt break downe the powers of the world, and then adminiſter righteouſneſſe unto the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſpirituall raigne of Chriſt, doth moſt of all beſuite the glory &amp; ſpirituality of his kingdome. Chriſt tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that <hi>his kingdome was not of this world,</hi> that is, it was not fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or carnall, but of a ſpirituall nature and quality. Chriſt coming in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to his Diſciples, did more enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, comfort, and ſpirituallize them, then his fleſhly preſence did, In <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 2, 3. It's ſayd of Chriſt, that he ſhould not <hi>judge after the ſight of his eyes, or the hearing of his eares,</hi> &amp;c. That is, he ſhall not judge according to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, but according to righteous judgement. The glory of the Saints in the latter dayes ſhall be ſpirituall, their knowledge ſpirituall, their comfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and joys ſhall be ſpirituall, yea Chriſt ſhall raigne by his divine preſence in his people, of whom ſhall be made up his ſpirituall kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is by the ſpirituall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119934:193"/>
of the Lords brightneſſe and glory, that he will deſtroy Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. What is the <hi>word</hi> of Chriſts <hi>mouth,</hi> and the <hi>brightneſſe</hi> of his <hi>coming?</hi> but the <hi>word</hi> of the witneſſes teſtimony, and the bright ſhinings forth of ſpirit, life, knowledge, and righteouſneſſe in his people, whereby the iniquity of the man of Sin is detected and laid open, whereby Antichriſt is deſtroyed, as by fire, waſting and conſuming him to nothing. Now by the ſame appearance, as in his people, will the Lord admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter righteouſneſſe, and goodneſſe to the world, as that whereby he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, all the glory that is ſpoken of Chriſt, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that ſhall be in the latter age, doth amount but to thus much; that the Lord will eminently manifeſt his gracious and ſpeciall preſence with his people. As in that 37 <hi>Ezek.</hi> latter end; The Lord ſpeaking of the glory he will bring upon his people, ſaith, <hi>I will Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle with them, and I will ſet my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the midſt of them for evermore,</hi> &amp;c. The Lords preſence and glory ſhall moſt of all appeare in the midſt of his
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119934:194"/>
people; he ſhall ſo manifeſt himſelfe, as to be admired in his Saints. So what doth all the glory of the coming down of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. imply, but onely thus much, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will Tabernacle with men, and I will dwell with them.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thereby, that as the Lord made the Tabernacle a ſigne &amp; pledge of his preſence with his people: ſo now in his laſt, and moſt glorious diſcovery of himſelfe, it ſhould be by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his divine preſence in his Saints, by erecting the Tabernacle of his owne ſpirit, life, and glory in the middeſt of them. And ſo much for the manner of Chriſts reigne. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, we are to conſider the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of Chriſt's reigne, and that is expreſſed <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> The raigne of Chriſt is an everlaſting raigne, he receives a kingdome, that <hi>cannot be ſhaken:</hi> there ſhall be no end of it: his Throne endureth for ever, and it ſhall never expire: let the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof uſe what craft or policie they will, they ſhall never deſtroy it. <hi>The God of heaven</hi> (ſaith the Prophet)
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:119934:194"/>
                  <hi>ſhall ſet up a kingdome, which ſhall never be deſtroyed: neither ſhall it be left to other people, but it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Dan. 2. 44. If that of the Apoſtle be objected, where he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt ſhall deliver up the kingdome to God, even the Father, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 24. I anſwer, that this doth nothing at all impeach the everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt's kingdome: for the meaning of it is this, that when Chriſt ſhall have finiſhed his worke, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his enemies, and have complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his worke upon his Saints, then he ſhall ceaſe to raigne any longer as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, he ſhall ceaſe to adminiſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his preſent diſpenſation and office, then <hi>God ſhall be all in all:</hi> God ſhall be <hi>all</hi> to his Saints, by the immediate and glorious communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his light and glory; and Saints ſhall enjoy the <hi>all</hi> of God, his wiſdome, his goodneſſe, his love, and the like. So that however the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt ſhall ceaſe, when he hath finiſhed his worke and office, and the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part of his kingdome ſhall ceaſe, yet in reſpect of the nature and being, it ſhall be for ever and ever: The raigne of God ſhall be to eternity, and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119934:195"/>
ſhall raigne in the Father, and Saints in Chriſt, ſo that God, and Chriſt, and his Saints, ſhall raigne for ever and ever. The Apoſtle doth ſtile Chriſt, to be a <hi>King eternall, and immortall,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 17. Chriſts kingdome is <hi>immortall,</hi> becauſe it is not ſubject to ſucceſſion; it's not liable to be devolved and rould downe to after-comers; which <hi>Daniel</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thus; <hi>His kingdome ſhall not be left unto other people;</hi> that is, it ſhall not be tranſlated from man to man, and at laſt quite diſſolved. And the Apoſtle doth not onely call Chriſt an <hi>immortall King,</hi> but alſo an <hi>eternall King,</hi> his kingdome ſhall hold on conſtantly throughout all Centuries and ages of the world; there is no period of time, that ſhall cauſe it to expire &amp; give up the ghoſt, but it ſhall attaine to it's full beautie and perfection, it ſhall never decline or decay, but ſhall laſt beyond all ages and times, it ſhall endure for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>But now concerning the glorious raigne of Chriſt, upon the downfall of Antichriſt, the time expreſſed to be a <hi>thouſand yeares,</hi> Revel. 20. And it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of Chriſt in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60. 15. that he
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:119934:195"/>
ſhould be <hi>the joy of many generations;</hi> both this expreſſion of <hi>many generations,</hi> and of a <hi>thouſand yeares,</hi> are an indefinit number, to expreſſe the very large and ſpacious time, wherein Chriſt ſhall rule in, and by his Saints, when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before his <hi>Ancients</hi> gloriouſly; and all the <hi>Elders</hi> before his Throne ſhall worſhip him. If it be objected, from <hi>Revel. 20. 4. That thoſe that had been beheaded for the teſtimony of Jeſus, and the word of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe lived and raigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeares, this being the firſt reſurrection, and the reſt of the dead lived not againe.</hi> I anſwer, that it cannot be meant that the perſons of thoſe that were beheaded for Jeſus, and refuſed to worſhip the beaſt or his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſhould bodily raigne with Chriſt: but that God will raiſe up a people of the ſame ſpirit with thoſe, that ſuffered for the teſtimony of Jeſus. Thus <hi>Elias</hi> was ſayd to come againe, in <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> And thus the Lord tells <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould ſtand in the lot at the end of the dayes,</hi> when his propheſie ſhould be fulfilled. All Saints gathered up into one ſpirit, they make but one. And thus we have the Prophet ſpeaking;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:119934:196"/>
                  <hi>And the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee,</hi> Zech. 14. 5. When the glory of God ſhall appeare more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Saints, in the time of his ſpirituall raigne, the glory of all the former Saints ſhall be gathered up in them, and appeare moſt gloriouſly. The reſurrecteon here ſpoken off, is meant of a reſurrection from ſhame and reproach, the witneſſes riſing from their ſadneſſe and ſackcloth, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into the glory of Chriſt's kingdome. And when the ſeventh Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the glory of the Lord be fully diſcovered and layd open, then all that heare the glorious ſound of the everlaſting Goſpel, ſhall live; but the reſt of the dead (that heare not the voyce of the ſeventh Trumpet, or that great proclamation of the truth and glory of Chriſt) they ſhall not live untill the <hi>thouſand yeares</hi> be paſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, if it be objected from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. That the Lord hath promiſed, to call the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and gather them into their <hi>owne Land,</hi> and make them <hi>one Nation,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> their King ſhall raigne over them. I anſwer,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:119934:196"/>
this propheſie is of a ſpiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall interpretation; for the land of Meſſiah are the Saints; of whom the land of Canaan was a type: for if we take it litterally, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould rebuild <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and dwell peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then alſo it muſt be meant, that <hi>David,</hi> and not Chriſt, ſhould be King over them. But we know that the promiſe doth onely borrow expreſſions, from the ſtate of the Jewiſh Church, but it ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in ſpirit: for <hi>he is a Jew, which is one inwardly,</hi> Rom. 2. 28. The <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be called when <hi>the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come,</hi> Rom. 11. 25. which is not meant, as if God would firſt finiſh his work among the Gentiles, and then call the <hi>Jewes</hi> as a peculiar people: but that the Jewes ſhould be brought in, with the fulneſſe of the Gentiles, when Antichriſt ſhall be ruined, and that which letteth be taken out of the way, and the everlaſting Goſpel goe forth with freedome, in the fulneſſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the Gentiles, ſhall the Jewes finde acceptance alſo.</p>
               <p>Now from all that hath been ſaid, of the kingdome and raigne of Chriſt,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:119934:197"/>
obſerve, <hi>That Chriſt will come and raigne</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſer:</note>

Satan and wicked men have reigned long; but now they ſhall ceaſe to reigne any longer. The whole earth ſhall be filled with the righteouſneſſe, goodneſſe, and glory of God, and the anointed ones of the Lord ſhall reigne; and the Saints ſhall reigne with him for ever; as it's ſayd, <hi>Revel. 5. He hath made us Kings and Prieſts to our God; and we ſhall reigne on the earth.</hi> The ſtrength, glory, riches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall be given unto us; we ſhall no longer be ſubject to Satan and wicked men; but we ſhall be brought into the glorious libertie of the ſons of God, and ſhall live in the new heaven and new earth, wherein dwells righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; our habitation ſhall be the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the holy Citie. Now all the ſervices of formall profeſſors, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Chriſtians ſhall be diſowned of God, <hi>Eſa</hi> 43. 20, 21. And humane mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie

ſhall be abhorred, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28. And <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be a burthenſome ſtone; breaking in pieces Kings and Kingdomes, States and powers, that ſhall take upon them to judge of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, that ſhall intermeddle with Church-work, or ſhall any wayes goe about to interpoſe between God, and the ſpirits of men. Becauſe none can, none ſhall reigne over the Saints, but the Lord himſelfe; Man hath had his time of power, and dominion, but now he is to give account of his Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardſhip, and reigne no longer.

               <p>IN this Verſe obſerve three things. Firſt, the <hi>title</hi> given to the ſervants of the Lord, his anointed ones, they are called <hi>Elders,</hi> becauſe the Lord doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with them, and in them, with much gravity and majeſty, by his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indwellings of his everlaſting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Theſe be his <hi>Ancients,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119934:198"/>
calls them, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24. 23. before whom the Lord doth appeare. Saints taken up into the <hi>Ancient of dayes,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the eternall ſpirit, theſe are called the <hi>Ancients,</hi> the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their <hi>number, twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foure:</hi> The number of the Apoſtles were <hi>twelve,</hi> but here is the number of <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-foure:</hi> anſwerable both to the <hi>twelve Tribes,</hi> and alſo to the twelve Apoſtles. Suitable hereunto is that place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 12. 14. In the deſcription of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it's ſayd, That upon the <hi>twelve gates</hi> thereof, were the names of the <hi>twelve Tribes,</hi> and upon the <hi>twelve foundations,</hi> the names of the <hi>twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> which doth demonſtrate, that the Spirit of God ſhall appeare in a double meaſure, twice as much as in the Apoſtles, theſe ſhall have a fuller meaſure of the Spirit: The <hi>names,</hi> the vertues, the gifts, the graces, both of the <hi>twelve Tribes,</hi> and <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> ſhall be engraven upon theſe anointed ones. Theſe ſhall enjoy a double mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Spirit, they ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as <hi>twelve,</hi> but as <hi>twenty-foure El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> before the Lord. Theſe are they
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:119934:199"/>
which <hi>ſat</hi> before God: as having rule and dominion with him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have their poſture and action; they <hi>fell upon their faces and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>They fell on their faces;</hi> that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their humility, and ſelfe-deniall, as diſclaiming all fleſhly glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, they doe as it were put their faces in the duſt, as abhorring their own beauty and excellency.</p>
               <p>2. They <hi>werſhip God:</hi> the time was, they did worſhip men, and meanes, they adored ſelfe &amp; creature: but now they <hi>caſt off their idols of Gold, and their idols of ſilver, which they made each one for himſelfe to worſhip, to the moles, and to the bats,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 20. And now they exalt the Lord alone, they worſhip him, and him onely. The voyce of praiſe follows.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>VERS. 17.</hi>—We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty: which art, and waſt, and art to come, becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</head>
               <p>HEre likewiſe three things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>praiſes</hi> of the Saints: <hi>we give thee thankes, &amp;c.</hi> They ſing the ſong of deliverance and joy; of triumph and victory, ſaying, <hi>we thanke thee O Lord:</hi> not to us, not to man, not to creature be the praiſe, but to thee O Lord, thou onely deſerveſt all praiſe, O Lord, God, Almightie, &amp; therefore we will praiſe thee onely. The Saints exalted into the liberty and glory of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they ſing the <hi>ſong of Moſes, and of the Lamb,</hi> Revel. 15. 2. They give thankes for deliverance and ſalvation-Their hearts, and their mouths are full of divine praiſes, they ſound forth <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs,</hi> and ſing aloud the glory of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They praiſe him, who is the <hi>everlaſting</hi> and <hi>eternall being: which
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119934:200"/>
art, and waſt, and art to come.</hi> Here we have the very circle of eternitie, that is moſt comprehenſive, and doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, both the beginning and end of all things. The Lord was before all creatures, and ſhall abide alwayes, though all creatures ſhould periſh: from him all creatures had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to him they are referred, as their utmoſt end. Therefore the Lord is worthy of all praiſe, being before all things: by whom all things are, and to whom all things tend; the Lord is the <hi>beginning, being,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of all things, meeting and concentering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>ground</hi> of their praiſe, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power, and haſt reigned.</hi> As if they had ſayd; Lord thou haſt given thy power to others, thou haſt let Satan, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and wicked men reigne on the earth: but now thou haſt taken thy power to thy ſelfe again, and haſt wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it out of the hands of earthly men, that have abuſed it, and thou wilt uſe it thy ſelfe. The men of the earth have reigned by wiſdome, policy, by plots, carrying on their own deſignes: but
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:119934:200"/>
the Lord will reigne in truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. It muſt needs be matter of great joy unto the earth, that the Lord will reigne: for while man reigned, there was nothing but oppreſſion on the earth, but the Lord rules &amp; reignes with deliverance and ſalvation. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="18" type="verse">
               <head>
                  <hi>VERS. 18.</hi> And the Nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they ſhould be judged, and that thou ſhouldeſt give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto thy ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to the Saints, and them that feare thy Name, ſmall and great, and ſhouldeſt deſtroy them which deſtroy the earth.</head>
               <p>FRom theſe words take notice. Firſt, how the adverſaries <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>fret,</hi> and doe even rage in furie and madneſſe: and good reaſon they have ſo to doe: for the <hi>time of their dead was come, that they ſhould be judged:</hi> all dead power, rule, and authority, all dead
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119934:201"/>
ordinances and ſervices, all the dead wayes and practiſes of Antichriſt, theſe muſt all be judged, condemned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: all things that have not the ſpirit and life of God in them, all theſe muſt be judged: well may the world then vex and rage, and gnaw their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ongues for paine. This is the reaſon of all that bitterneſſe, malice, ſury, and madneſſe, that is in the hearts of men at this day, what makes them vexing and fretting, but that all things they ſet up, maintaine, enjoy, and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, are judged and condemned for dead power, dead ordinances, dead gifts, all things of man are judged to be dead. When the Lord comes to judge the earth, confuſion and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire goes before his face, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 2. which muſt needs make that judgement very dreadfull and terrible to all formall powers, and fleſhly act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: eſpecially becauſe the <hi>Saints ſhall judge the world,</hi> yea, <hi>and Angells alſo, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. They ſhall judge men, and things of higheſt principles and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoſe things that carry a civill or ſpirituall excellency upon them, ſhall be judged by the Saints. What follows?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:119934:201"/>Secondly, The Saints are <hi>rewarded</hi> and <hi>advanced, And that thou ſhouldeſt give reward unto thy ſervants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and them that feare thy Name ſmall and great.</hi> As the portion of the world is, vexing, fretting, curſing, and wrath: ſo the portion of Saints is love, goodneſſe, bleſſings, thankeſgivings. The dreadfull day of doome and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of judgement and confuſion unto the world, is a day of light and joy, of comfort and reward unto the Saints. The worlds trouble and ruine, is the Saints peace and ſalvation. Though the Lord come in fire and wrath to deſtroy Antichriſt, yet he comes in love and mercy to ſave <hi>Sion;</hi> and therefore, when he comes forth, and <hi>a devouring fire, burning up his enemies round about,</hi> Pſal. 97. 3. <hi>Yet Sion heard and was glad, and the daughter of Judah rejoyced, becauſe of his judgements,</hi> verſ. 8. The Saints have been a long time under oppreſſion, ſhame, and perſecution: now the Lord will reward them, and give them light for darkneſſe, ſtrength for weakneſſe, glory for ſhame: they ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reward and praiſe, for all their former ſorrow and ſufferings. The
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:119934:202"/>
Saints ſhall rejoyce in heaven for the vengeance powred out upon Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: <hi>Therefore rejoyce over her, thou heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her,</hi> Revel. 18. 20. When the Kings of the earth, and Merchants, mightie and rich men ſhall weep and wayl, and cry alas, alas, then ſhall the Saints (here called the holy Apoſtles and Prophets) rejoyce and ſing: becauſe the ruine and fall of theſe, ſhall be their joy and reward.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord will not onely judge the dead principles, practices, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and powers of Antichriſt, and give reward unto his ſervants; but alſo will deſtroy the Antichriſtian partie. <hi>And ſhouldeſt deſtroy them which deſtroy the earth.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>deſtroy,</hi> ſignifies <hi>corrupt:</hi> that is, Thoſe that have managed the cauſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, have <hi>corrupted</hi> the earth; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it's ſaid in <hi>Revel. 19. 2. The great whore did corrupt the earth with her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> That is, by her ſoſſeries and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, ſhe hath corrupted the minds of the men of the earth, drawing them aſide from the Lord, by the intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wine of her fornication, ſhe hath
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:119934:202"/>
blinded the mindes, adulterated the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and polluted the hearts of the men of the world, and have made them to ſerve Satan the God of this world. Theſe that have managed the cauſe of the beaſt, and have thus corrupted the earth, ſhall be deſtroyed. This deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſo much meant of a bodily deſtruction, as of place and power: theſe that have by their power &amp; rule, by their deceit and falſhood corrupted the earth, theſe in their dignity, office, rule and authoritie ſhall all be ſlaine. It followeth.</p>

                  <hi>VERS. 19.</hi> And the Temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was ſeen in the Temple the Arke of his Teſtament, and there was lightnings, and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thunderings, &amp; an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and great hail.</head>
               <p>COnſider three things from theſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Temple of God opened.</hi> The time was it was ſhut up, as once the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:119934:203"/>
Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was under <hi>Ahaz, 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 24. So this ſpirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ſhut up, when it was meaſured in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. When the outward Court, or viſible face of things were in the hands of the Gentiles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. The Church was driven into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for many yeares into deſert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there to be nouriſhed for a time, from the face of the Serpent, that ſought to devoure her. But now the Temple is ſet open, as of old it was by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 29. 3. Thus it's ſaid of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>the gates ſhould not be ſhut,</hi> Revel. 21. 25. And the reaſon is, becauſe there ſhall be no night, nor danger, the gates ſhall ſtand open continually. This noteth the free acceſſe for multitudes of Saints to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> without impediment or ſtop. Not as in times of perſecution, when they ſought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord in corners; but they ſhall come and enter freely and boldly, and that without let or moleſtation. So that the woman ſhall no more be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Wilderneſſe, and ſhut up there, but the Temple of God ſhall be ſet open, and there ſhall be a free and great acceſſe unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:119934:203"/>Secondly, That which appeared in the Temple was the <hi>Arke of his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> As the Temple was opened, ſo the Arke was made <hi>viſible,</hi> which was ſhut from the eyes of men, under the old Teſtament, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 19. It was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldome ſeen, and that by the high-Prieſt onely: the Arke was a pledge of Gods preſence with his people, and denotes unto us, the myſteries of truth, which formerly lay hid, but now are made manifeſt. The great high-Prieſt hath opened the Temple, and made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Arke, by making knowne the myſteries of truth. In former time the Church was in the Wilderneſſe, the Gentiles poſſeſſed the outward Court, lets of truth were diſcovered, onely ſomething was hinted out by a few choiſe inſtruments: but now the Saints have a Temple opened, a full and free acceſſe: and now they have an Arke made viſible, or the hidden myſteries of God revealed; not onely to a few called <hi>Clergie men,</hi> but generally to all Saints the knowledge of the truth is revealed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The cloſe of all, <hi>And there were lightnings, and voyces, and thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:119934:204"/>
and an earth-quake, and great hail.</hi> Earth-quake, hail, and lightning, ſet forth Gods judgements moſt terrible and irreſiſtible, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 30. Of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake wee have ſpoken before from <hi>verſ.</hi> 13 of this Chapter: Hail-ſtones was one of the plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that deſtroyed their trees, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 25. And by which the <hi>Amorites</hi> were deſtroyed in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Joſh. 10. 11. By theſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wee have the finall deſtruction of Antichriſt. This is the <hi>third woe,</hi> that ſhall accompany the ſeventh Trumpet, and is agreeable to the plagues of the ſeventh Viall, by which Antichriſt ſhall be wholly deſtroyed; and ſhould blaſpheme God, becauſe of the plague of the hail, that was exceeding great. By this laſt and great judgement, the myſterie of iniquitie is diſcovered, and the power of Antichriſt wholly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, at which his partie ſhall vex and fret, gnaw their tongues, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God for all their paines &amp; ſores, whereby they ſhall be utterly ruined and conſumed.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the Effects of Chriſts kingdome and reigne layd open: wee ſee for what it is, that the <hi>Elders</hi> doe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:119934:204"/>
ſo exceedingly praiſe the Lord, for that he takes to himſelfe his great power, and doth reigne, by which he doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Nations, and reward his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Temple is no more ſhut up under reſtraint, but free acceſſe is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the Arke is no more hidden, but the myſteries of ſalvation made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And the Lord by his ſweeping judgements will wholly conſume An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, both in his policy and power. Hence it is, that the Saints ſhall thus triumph and rejoyce; How can the daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> but rejoyce when he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th ſhall be at peace, and be quiet, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 14. 4. 7. When Chriſt ſhall come to reigne in his appearance in his Saints, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſhall <hi>judge the Nations with righteouſneſſe, and governe the people with truth.</hi> Pſal. 67. 4. 7. Therefore when the Lord ſhall come to reigne, to ſet all things in order,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:119934:205"/>
to governe and give ſettlement to the Nations: well may Antichriſt vex and fret, and all oppreſſing powers be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; but the Saints ſhall rejoyce and ſing; and all the world beſides ſhall be glad, becauſe of his righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So much to be ſpoken of the Effects of Chriſt's reigne, and ſo I end this whole Diſcourſe.</p>
